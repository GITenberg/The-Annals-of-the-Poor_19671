5</span>THE DAIRYMAN&rsquo;S DAUGHTER.</h2>
<h3>PART I.</h3>
<p>It is a delightful employment to discover and trace the 
operations of divine grace, as they are manifested in the 
dispositions and lives of God&rsquo;s real children.&nbsp; It is 
peculiarly gratifying to observe how frequently among the poorer 
classes of mankind the sunshine of mercy beams upon the heart, 
and bears witness to the image of Christ which the Spirit of God 
has impressed thereupon.&nbsp; Among such, the sincerity and 
simplicity of the Christian character appear unencumbered by 
those obstacles to spirituality of mind and conversation which 
too often prove a great hindrance to those who live in the higher
ranks.&nbsp; Many are the difficulties which riches, worldly 
consequence, high connections, and the luxuriant refinements of 
polished society, throw in the way of religious profession.&nbsp;
Happy indeed it is (and some such happy instances I know) where 
grace has so strikingly supported its conflict with natural 
pride, self-importance, the allurements of luxury, ease, and 
worldly opinion, that the noble and mighty appear <!-- page 
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>adorned 
with genuine poverty of spirit, self-denial, humble-mindedness, 
and deep spirituality of heart.</p>
<p>But, in general, if we want to see religion in its most simple
and pure character, we must look for it among the poor of this 
world who are rich in faith.&nbsp; How often is the poor 
man&rsquo;s cottage the palace of God!&nbsp; Many can truly 
declare that they have there learned the most valuable lessons of
faith and hope, and there witnessed the most striking 
demonstrations of the wisdom, power, and goodness of God.</p>
<p>The character which the present narrative is designed to 
introduce to the notice of my readers is given <i>from real life 
and circumstances</i>.&nbsp; I first became acquainted with her 
by receiving the following letter, which I transcribe from the 
original now before me:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take the liberty to write to you.&nbsp; Pray excuse 
me, for I have never spoken to you.&nbsp; But I once heard you, 
when you preached at --- Church.&nbsp; I believe you are a 
faithful preacher to warn sinners to flee from the wrath that 
will be revealed against all those that live in sin, and die 
impenitent.&nbsp; Pray go on in the strength of the Lord.&nbsp; 
And may he bless you, and crown your labour of love with success,
and give you souls for your hire!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord has promised to be with those whom he calls 
and sends forth to preach his word, to the end of time; for 
without him we can do nothing.&nbsp; I was much rejoiced to hear 
of those marks of love and affection to that poor soldier of the 
S. D. militia.&nbsp; Surely the love of Christ sent you to that 
poor man.&nbsp; May that love ever dwell richly in you by 
faith!&nbsp; <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>May it constrain you to seek the 
wandering souls of men with the fervent desire to spend and be 
spent for his glory!&nbsp; May the unction of the Holy Spirit 
attend the word spoken by you with power, and convey deep 
conviction to the hearts of your hearers!&nbsp; May many of them 
experience the divine change of being made new creatures in 
Christ!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, be fervent in prayer with God for the conversion 
of sinners.&nbsp; His power is great, and who can withstand 
it?&nbsp; He has promised to answer the prayer of faith, that is 
put up in his Son&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ask what ye will, it
shall be granted you.&rsquo;&nbsp; How this should strengthen our
faith, when we are taught by the word and the Spirit how to 
pray!&nbsp; Oh, that sweet inspiring hope! how it lifts up the 
fainting spirits, when we look over the precious promises of 
God!&nbsp; What a mercy if we know Christ and the power of his 
resurrection in our own hearts!&nbsp; Through faith in Christ we 
rejoice in hope, and look up in expectation of that time drawing 
near when all shall know and fear the Lord, and when a nation 
shall be born in a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a happy time when Christ&rsquo;s kingdom shall 
come!&nbsp; Then shall &lsquo;his will be done on earth as it is 
in heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Men shall be daily fed with the manna of 
his love, and delight themselves with the Lord all the day 
long.&nbsp; Then what a paradise below they will enjoy!&nbsp; How
it animates and enlivens my soul with vigour to pursue the ways 
of God, that I may even now bear some humble part in giving glory
to God and the Lamb!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I began to write this on Sunday, being detained 
from attending on public worship.&nbsp; My dear and only sister, 
living as a servant with Mrs. ---, was so ill, that I came here 
to attend in her place and on her.&nbsp; But now she is no 
more.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
8</span>&ldquo;I was going to entreat you to write to her in 
answer to this, she being convinced of the evil of her past life,
and that she had not walked in the ways of God, nor sought to 
please him.&nbsp; But she earnestly desired to do so.&nbsp; This 
makes me have a comfortable hope that she is gone to glory, and 
that she is now joining in sweet concert with the angelic host in
heaven to sing the wonders of redeeming love.&nbsp; I hope I may 
now write, &lsquo;Blessed are the dead that die in the 
Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She expressed a desire to receive the Lord&rsquo;s 
Supper, and commemorate his precious death and sufferings.&nbsp; 
I told her as well as I was able what it was to receive Christ 
into her heart; but as her weakness of body increased, she did 
not mention it again.&nbsp; She seemed quite resigned before she 
died.&nbsp; I do hope she is gone from a world of death and sin 
to be with God for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I hope you will not be offended with me, a poor 
ignorant person, to take such a liberty as to write to you.&nbsp;
But I trust, as you are called to instruct sinners in the ways of
God, you will bear with me, and be so kind to answer this 
ill-wrote letter, and give me some instruction.&nbsp; It is my 
heart&rsquo;s desire to have the mind that was in Christ, that 
when I awake up in his likeness then I may be satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister expressed a wish that you might bury 
her.&nbsp; The minister of our parish, whither she will be 
carried, cannot come.&nbsp; She will lie at ---.&nbsp; She died 
on Tuesday morning, and will be buried on Friday or Saturday 
(whichever is most convenient to you), at three o&rsquo;clock in 
the afternoon.&nbsp; Please to send an answer by the bearer, to 
let me know whether you can comply with this request</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your unworthy servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Elizabeth W---</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
9</span>I was much struck with the simple and earnest strain of 
devotion which this letter breathed.&nbsp; It was but 
indifferently written and spelt.&nbsp; But this the rather tended
to endear the hitherto unknown writer, as it seemed 
characteristic of the union of humbleness of station with 
eminence of piety.&nbsp; I felt quite thankful that I was 
favoured with a correspondent of this description; the more so, 
as such characters were at that time very rare in the 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I have often wished that epistolary 
intercourse of this kind were more encouraged and practised among
us.&nbsp; I have the greatest reason to speak well of its effects
both on myself and others.&nbsp; Communication by letter as well 
as by conversation with the pious poor has often been the 
instrument of animating and reviving my own heart in the midst of
duty, and of giving me the most profitable information for the 
general conduct of the ministerial office.</p>
<p>As soon as the letter was read I inquired who was the bearer 
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is waiting at the outside of the gate, sir,&rdquo; 
was the reply.</p>
<p>I went out to speak him, and saw a venerable old man, whose 
long hoary hair and deeply wrinkled countenance commanded more 
than common respect.&nbsp; He was resting his arm upon the gate, 
and tears were streaming down his cheeks.&nbsp; On my approach he
made a low bow, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have brought you a letter from my daughter, but 
I fear you will think us very bold in asking you to take so much 
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I shall be truly 
glad to oblige you and any of your family in this matter, 
provided it be quite agreeable to the minister of your 
parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>&ldquo;Sir, he told me yesterday that he should be very 
glad if I could procure some gentleman to come and bury my poor 
child for him, as he lives five miles off, and has particular 
business on that day; so when I told my daughter, she asked me to
come to you, sir, and bring that letter, which would explain the 
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I desired him to come into the house, and then 
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your occupation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have lived most of my days in a little cottage 
at ---, six miles from here.&nbsp; I have rented a few acres of 
ground, and kept some cows, which, in addition to my day-labour, 
has been the means of supporting and bringing up my 
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What family have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wife, now getting very aged and helpless; two sons, 
and one daughter; for my other poor dear child is just departed 
out of this wicked world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope for a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so too.&nbsp; Poor thing, she did not use to 
take to such good ways as her sister; but I do believe that her 
sister&rsquo;s manner of talking with her before she died was the
means of saving her soul.&nbsp; What a mercy it is to have such a
child as mine is!&nbsp; I never thought about my own soul 
seriously till she, poor girl, begged me to flee from the wrath 
to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near seventy, and my wife is older.&nbsp; We are 
getting old, and almost past our labour, but our daughter has 
left a good place, where she lived in service, on purpose to come
home and take care of us and our little dairy.&nbsp; And a dear, 
dutiful, affectionate girl she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>&ldquo;Was she always so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; when she was very young she was all for the 
world, and pleasure, and dress, and company.&nbsp; Indeed we were
all very ignorant, and thought if we took care for this life, and
wronged nobody, we should be sure to go to heaven at last.&nbsp; 
My daughters were both wilful, and, like ourselves, strangers to 
the ways of God and the word of his grace.&nbsp; But the eldest 
of them went out to service, and some years ago she heard a 
sermon, preached at --- church by a gentleman that was going to 
--- as chaplain to the colony, and from that time she seemed 
quite another creature.&nbsp; She began to read the Bible, and 
became sober and steady.&nbsp; The first time she returned home 
afterwards to see us she brought us a guinea, which she had saved
from her wages, and said, as we were getting old, she was sure we
should want help, adding, that she did not wish to spend it in 
fine clothes as she used to do, only to feed pride and 
vanity.&nbsp; She said she would rather show gratitude to her 
dear father and mother, because Christ had shown such mercy to 
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wondered to hear her talk, and took great delight in
her company; for her temper and behaviour were so humble and 
kind, she seemed so desirous to do us good both in soul and body,
and was so different from what we had ever seen her before, that 
careless and ignorant as we had been, we began to think there 
must be something real in religion, or it never could alter a 
person so much in a little time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her youngest sister, poor soul! used to laugh and 
ridicule her at that time, and said her head was turned with her 
new ways.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, sister,&rsquo; she would say, 
&lsquo;not my <i>head</i> <!-- page 12--><a 
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>but I hope my
<i>heart</i> is turned from the love of sin to the love of 
God.&nbsp; I wish you may one day see, as I do, the danger and 
vanity of your present condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her poor sister would reply, &lsquo;I do not want to 
hear any of your preaching; I am no worse than other people, and 
that is enough for me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, sister,&rsquo; 
Elizabeth would say, &lsquo;if you will not hear me, you cannot 
hinder me from praying for you, which I do with all my 
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, I believe those prayers are 
answered.&nbsp; For when her sister was taken ill, Elizabeth went
to Mrs. ---&rsquo;s to wait in her place, and take care of 
her.&nbsp; She said a great deal to her about her soul, and the 
poor girl began to be so deeply affected and sensible of her past
sin, and so thankful for her sister&rsquo;s kind behaviour, that 
it gave her great hopes indeed for her sake.&nbsp; When my wife 
and I went to see her as she lay sick, she told us how grieved 
and ashamed she was of her past life, but said she had a hope, 
through grace, that her dear sister&rsquo;s Saviour would be her 
Saviour too, for she saw her own sinfulness, felt her own 
helplessness, and only wished to cast herself upon Christ as her 
hope and salvation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, she is gone, and I hope and think her 
sister&rsquo;s prayers for her conversion to God have been 
answered.&nbsp; The Lord grant the same for her poor father and 
mother&rsquo;s sake likewise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation was a very pleasing commentary upon the 
letter which I had received, and made me anxious both to comply 
with the request and to become acquainted with the writer.&nbsp; 
I promised the good dairyman to attend on the Friday at the 
appointed hour; and after some more conversation respecting his 
own state of mind under the present trial, he went away.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
13</span>He was a reverend old man; his furrowed cheeks, white 
locks, weeping eyes, bent shoulders, and feeble gait, were 
characteristic of the aged pilgrim.&nbsp; As he slowly walked 
onward, supported by a stick, which seemed to have been the 
companion of many a long year, a train of reflections occurred, 
which I retrace with pleasure and emotion.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour I arrived at the church, and after a 
little while was summoned to the churchyard gate to meet the 
funeral procession.&nbsp; The aged parents, the elder brother, 
and the sister, with other relatives, formed an affecting 
group.&nbsp; I was struck with the humble, pious, and pleasing 
countenance of the young woman from whom I had received the 
letter.&nbsp; It bore the marks of great seriousness without 
affectation, and of much serenity mingled with a glow of 
devotion.</p>
<p>A circumstance occurred during the reading of the Burial 
Service, which I think it right to mention as one among many 
testimonies of the solemn and impressive tendency of our truly 
evangelical Liturgy.</p>
<p>A man of the village, who had hitherto been of a very careless
and even profligate character, went into the church through mere 
curiosity, and with no better purpose than that of vacantly 
gazing at the ceremony.&nbsp; He came likewise to the grave, and 
during the reading of those prayers which are appointed for that 
part of the service, his mind received a deep, serious conviction
of his sin and spiritual danger.&nbsp; It was an impression that 
never wore off, but gradually ripened into the most satisfactory 
evidence of an entire change, of which I had many and 
long-continued proofs.&nbsp; He always referred to the Burial 
Service, and to some particular sentences of it, as the clearly 
ascertained instrument <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of bringing him, through grace, to 
the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>The day was therefore one to be remembered.&nbsp; Remembered 
let it be by those who love to hear &ldquo;the short and simple 
annals of the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was there not a manifest and happy connection between the 
circumstances that providentially brought the serious and the 
careless to the same grave on that day together?&nbsp; How much 
do <i>they</i> lose who neglect to trace the leadings of God in 
providence as links in the chain of his eternal purpose of 
redemption and grace!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;While infidels may scoff, let us 
adore!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the service was concluded I had a short conversation 
with the good old couple and their daughter.&nbsp; She told me 
that she intended to remain a week or two at the 
gentleman&rsquo;s house where her sister died till another 
servant should arrive and take her sister&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be truly obliged,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;by an
opportunity of conversing with you, either there or at my 
father&rsquo;s when I return home, which will be in the course of
a fortnight at the furthest.&nbsp; I shall be glad to talk to you
about my sister, whom you have just buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her aspect and address were highly interesting.&nbsp; I 
promised to see her very soon, and then returned home, quietly 
reflecting on the circumstances of the funeral at which I had 
been engaged.&nbsp; I blessed the God of the poor, and prayed 
that the poor might become rich in faith, and the rich be made 
poor in spirit.</p>
<h3><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>PART II.</h3>
<p>A sweet solemnity often possesses the mind whilst retracing 
past intercourse with departed friends.&nbsp; How much is this 
increased when they were such as lived and died in the 
Lord!&nbsp; The remembrance of former scenes and conversations 
with those who, we believe, are now enjoying the uninterrupted 
happiness of a better world, fills the heart with pleasing 
sadness, and animates the soul with the hopeful anticipation of a
day when the glory of the Lord shall be revealed in the 
assembling of all his children together, never more to be 
separated.&nbsp; Whether they were rich or poor while on earth is
a matter of trifling consequence: the valuable part of their 
character is, that they are &ldquo;kings and priests unto 
God;&rdquo; and this is their true nobility.&nbsp; In the number 
of now departed believers, with whom I once loved to converse on 
the grace and glory of the kingdom of God, was the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>About a week after the funeral, I went to visit the family at 
---, in whose service the younger sister had lived and died, and 
where Elizabeth was requested to remain for a short time in her 
stead.</p>
<p>The house was a large and venerable mansion.&nbsp; It stood in
a beautiful valley at the foot of a high hill.&nbsp; It was 
embowered in fine woods, which were interspersed in every 
direction with rising, falling, and swelling grounds.&nbsp; The 
manor-house had evidently descended through a long line of 
ancestry, from a distant period of time.&nbsp; The Gothic 
character of its original architecture was still preserved in 
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
16</span>the latticed windows, adorned with carved divisions and 
pillars and stonework.&nbsp; Several pointed terminations also, 
in the construction of the roof, according to the custom of our 
forefathers, fully corresponded with the general features of the 
building.</p>
<p>One end of the house was entirely clothed with the thick 
foliage of an immense ivy, which climbed beyond customary limits,
and embraced a lofty chimney up to its very summit.&nbsp; Such a 
tree seemed congenial to the walls that supported it, and 
conspired with the antique fashion of the place to carry 
imagination back to the days of our ancestors.</p>
<p>As I approached, I was led to reflect on the lapse of ages, 
and the successive generations of men, each in their turn 
occupying lands, houses, and domains; each in their turn also 
disappearing, and leaving their inheritance to be enjoyed by 
others.&nbsp; David once observed the same, and cried out, 
&ldquo;Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth, and mine
age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
is altogether vanity.&nbsp; Surely every man walketh in a vain 
show; surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, 
and knoweth not who shall gather them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy would it be for the rich if they more frequently 
meditated on the uncertainty of all their possessions, and the 
frail nature of every earthly tenure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their inward 
thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their 
dwelling-places to all generations: they call their lands after 
their own names.&nbsp; Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth 
not: he is like the beasts that perish.&nbsp; This their way is 
their folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings.&nbsp; 
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on <!-- 
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>them; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from 
their dwelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I advanced to the mansion, a pleasing kind of gloom 
overspread the front: it was occasioned by the shade of trees, 
and gave a characteristic effect to the ancient fabric.&nbsp; I 
instantly recollected that death had very recently visited the 
house and that one of its present inhabitants was an affectionate
mourner for a departed sister.</p>
<p>There is a solemnity in the thought of a recent death, which 
will associate itself with the very walls from whence we are 
conscious that a soul has just taken its flight to eternity.</p>
<p>After passing some time in conversation with the superiors of 
the family, in the course of which I was much gratified by 
hearing of the unremitted attention which the elder sister had 
paid to the younger during the illness of the latter, I received 
likewise other testimonies of the excellency of her general 
character and conduct in the house.&nbsp; I then took leave, 
requesting permission to see her, agreeably to the promise I had 
made at the funeral, not many days before.</p>
<p>I was shown into a parlour, where I found her alone.&nbsp; She
was in deep mourning.&nbsp; She had a calmness and serenity in 
her countenance which exceedingly struck me, and impressed some 
idea of those attainments which a further acquaintance with her 
afterwards so much increased.</p>
<p>She spoke of her sister.&nbsp; I had the satisfaction of 
finding that she had given very hopeful proofs of a change of 
heart before she died.&nbsp; The prayers and earnest exhortations
of Elizabeth had been blessed to a happy effect.&nbsp; She 
described what had passed with such a mixture of sisterly 
affection and pious dependence on the mercy of God to sinners, as
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
18</span>convinced me that her own heart was under the influence 
of &ldquo;pure and undefiled religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She requested leave occasionally to correspond with me on 
serious subjects, stating that she needed much instruction.&nbsp;
She hoped I would pardon the liberty which she had taken by 
introducing herself to my notice.&nbsp; She expressed a trust 
that the Lord would overrule both the death of her sister and the
personal acquaintance with me that resulted from it, to a present
and future good, as it respected herself, and also her parents, 
with whom she statedly lived, and to whom she expected to return 
in a few days.</p>
<p>Finding that she was wanted in some household duty, I did not 
remain long with her, but left her with an assurance that I 
proposed to visit her parents very shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I take it very kind that 
you have condescended to leave the company of the rich, and 
converse with the poor.&nbsp; I wish I could have said more to 
you respecting my own state of mind.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall be 
better able another time.&nbsp; When you next visit me, instead 
of finding me in these noble walls, you will see me in a poor 
cottage.&nbsp; But I am happiest when there.&nbsp; Once more, 
sir, I thank you for your past kindness to me and mine, and may 
God in many ways bless you for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quitted the house with no small degree of satisfaction, in 
consequence of the new acquaintance which I had formed.&nbsp; I 
discovered traces of a cultivated as well as a spiritual 
mind.&nbsp; I felt that religious intercourse with those of low 
estate may be rendered eminently useful to others, whose outward 
station and advantages are far above their own.</p>
<p>How often does it appear that &ldquo;God hath chosen the weak 
things of the world to confound the things which are mighty <!--

19</span>and base things of the world, and things which are 
despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to 
nought things that are; that no flesh should glory in his 
presence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not unfrequently my custom, when my mind was filled 
with any interesting subject for meditation, to seek some spot 
where the beauties of natural prospect might help to form 
pleasing and useful associations.&nbsp; I therefore ascended 
gradually to the very summit of the hill adjoining the mansion 
where my visit had just been made.&nbsp; Here was placed an 
elevated sea-mark: it was in the form of a triangular pyramid, 
and built of stone.&nbsp; I sat down on the ground near it, and 
looked at the surrounding prospect, which was distinguished for 
beauty and magnificence.&nbsp; It was a lofty station, which 
commanded a complete circle of interesting objects to engage the 
spectator&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; Southward the view was 
terminated by a long range of hills, at about six miles 
distance.&nbsp; They met to the westward another chain of hills, 
of which the one whereon I sat formed a link, and the whole 
together nearly encompassed a rich and fruitful valley, filled 
with cornfields and pastures.&nbsp; Through this vale winded a 
small river for many miles: much cattle were feeding on its 
banks.&nbsp; Here and there lesser eminences arose in the valley:
some covered with wood, others with corn or grass, and a few with
heath or fern.&nbsp; One of these little hills was distinguished 
by a parish church at the top, presenting a striking feature in 
the landscape.&nbsp; Another of these elevations, situated in the
centre of the valley, was adorned with a venerable holly-tree, 
which has grown there for ages.&nbsp; Its singular height and 
wide-spreading dimensions not only render it an object of 
curiosity to the traveller, but of daily <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>usefulness to
the pilot, as a mark visible from the sea, whereby to direct his 
vessel safe into harbour.&nbsp; Villages, churches, 
country-seats, farm-houses, and cottages, were scattered over 
every part of the southern valley.&nbsp; In this direction also, 
at the foot of the hill where I was stationed, appeared the 
ancient mansion which I had just quitted, embellished with its 
woods, groves, and gardens.</p>
<p>South-eastward I saw the open ocean, bounded only by the 
horizon.&nbsp; The sun shone, and gilded the waves with a 
glittering light that sparkled in the most brilliant 
manner.&nbsp; More to the east, in continuation of that line of 
hills where I was placed, rose two downs, one beyond the other, 
both covered with sheep, and the sea just visible over the 
furthest of them, as a terminating boundary.&nbsp; In this point 
ships were seen, some sailing, others at anchor.&nbsp; Here the 
little river which watered the southern valley finished its 
course, and ran through meadows into the sea, in an eastward 
direction.</p>
<p>On the north the sea appeared like a noble river, varying from
three to seven miles in breadth, between the banks of the 
opposite coast and those of the island which I inhabited.&nbsp; 
Immediately underneath me was a fine woody district of country, 
diversified by many pleasing objects.&nbsp; Distant towns were 
visible on the opposite shore.&nbsp; Numbers of ships occupied 
the sheltered station which this northern channel afforded 
them.&nbsp; The eye roamed with delight over an expanse of near 
and remote beauties, which alternately caught the observation, 
and which harmonized together, and produced a scene of peculiar 
interest.</p>
<p>Westward the hills followed each other, forming several 
intermediate and partial valleys, in a kind of undulations, <!-- 
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>like the waves of the sea; and, bending to the south, 
completed the boundary of the larger valley before described, to 
the southward of the hill on which I sat.&nbsp; In many instances
the hills were cultivated with corn to their very summits, and 
seemed to defy the inclemency of the weather, which, at these 
heights, usually renders the ground incapable of bringing forth 
and ripening the crops of grain.&nbsp; One hill alone, the 
highest in elevation, and about ten miles to the south-westward, 
was enveloped in a cloud, which just permitted a dim and hazy 
sight of a signal-post, a light-house, and an ancient chantry, 
built on its summit.</p>
<p>Amidst these numerous specimens of delightful scenery I found 
a mount for contemplation, and here I indulged it.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;How much of the natural beauties of Paradise still remain 
in the world, although its spiritual character has been so 
awfully defaced by sin!&nbsp; But when divine grace renews the 
heart of the fallen sinner, Paradise is regained, and much of its
beauty restored to the soul.&nbsp; As this prospect is compounded
of hill and dale, land and sea, woods and plains, all sweetly 
blended together, and relieving each other in the landscape; so 
do the gracious dispositions wrought in the soul produce a beauty
and harmony of scene to which it was before a 
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked towards the village in the plain below, where the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s younger daughter was buried.&nbsp; I retraced 
the simple solemnities of the funeral.&nbsp; I connected the 
principles and conduct of her sister with the present probably 
happy state of her soul in the world of spirits, and was greatly 
impressed with a sense of the importance of family influence as a
means of grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;That young woman,&rdquo; I thought, 
&ldquo;has been the conductor of not only a sister, but <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
22</span>perhaps a father and mother also, to the true knowledge 
of God, and may, by the divine blessing, become so to 
others.&nbsp; It is a glorious occupation to win souls to Christ,
and guide them out of Egyptian bondage through the wilderness 
into the promised Canaan.&nbsp; Happy are the families who are 
walking hand in hand together, as pilgrims, towards the heavenly 
country.&nbsp; May the number of such be daily 
increased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting my eye over the numerous dwellings in the vales on my 
right and left, I could not help thinking, &ldquo;How many of 
their inhabitants are ignorant of the ways of God, and strangers 
to his grace!&nbsp; May this thought stimulate to activity and 
diligence in the cause of immortal souls!&nbsp; They are precious
in God&rsquo;s sight&mdash;they ought to be so in 
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some pointed and affecting observations to that effect 
recurred to my mind as having been made by the young person with 
whom I had been just conversing.&nbsp; Her mind appeared to be 
much impressed with the duty of speaking and acting for God 
&ldquo;while it is day,&rdquo; conscious that &ldquo;the night 
cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her laudable anxiety 
on this head was often testified to me afterwards, both by letter
and conversation.&nbsp; What she felt herself, in respect to 
endeavours to do good, she happily communicated to others with 
whom she corresponded or conversed.</p>
<p>Time would not permit my continuing so long in the enjoyment 
of these meditations, on this lovely mount of observation, as my 
heart desired.&nbsp; On my return home I wrote a few lines to the
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, chiefly dictated by the train of 
thought which had occupied my mind while I sat on the hill.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>On the next Sunday evening I received her reply, of 
which the following is a transcript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am this day deprived of an opportunity of attending 
the house of God, to worship him.&nbsp; But, glory be to his 
name, he is not confined to time or place.&nbsp; I feel him 
present with me where I am, and his presence makes my paradise; 
for where he is, is heaven.&nbsp; I pray God that a double 
portion of his grace and Holy Spirit may rest upon you this day; 
that his blessing may attend all your faithful labours; and that 
you may find the truth of his word assuring us that wherever we 
assemble together in his name, there is he in the midst to bless 
every waiting soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How precious are all his promises!&nbsp; We ought never
to doubt the truth of his word.&nbsp; For he will never deceive 
us if we go on in faith, always expecting to receive what his 
goodness waits to give.&nbsp; Dear sir, I have felt it very 
consoling to read your kind letter to-day.&nbsp; I feel thankful 
to God for ministers in our church who love and fear his name: 
there it is where the people in general look for salvation; and 
there may they ever find it, for Jesus&rsquo; sake!&nbsp; May his
word, spoken by you, his chosen vessel of grace, be made spirit 
and life to their dead souls!&nbsp; May it come from you as an 
instrument in the hands of God, as sharp arrows from a strong 
archer, and strike a death-blow to all their sins!&nbsp; How I 
long to see the arrows of conviction fasten on the minds of those
that are hearers of the word, and not doers!&nbsp; O sir, be 
ambitious for the glory of God and the salvation of souls!&nbsp; 
It will add to the lustre of your crown in glory, as well as to 
your present joy and peace.&nbsp; We should be <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>willing to 
spend and be spent in his service, saying, &lsquo;Lord, may thy 
will be done by me on earth, even as it is by the angels in 
heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; So you may expect to see his face with joy, 
and say, &lsquo;Here am I, Lord, and all the souls thou hast 
given me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems wonderful that we should neglect any 
opportunity of doing good, when there is, if it be done from love
to God and his creatures, a present reward of grace, in 
reflecting that we are using the talents committed to our care, 
according to the power and ability which we receive from 
him.&nbsp; God requires not what he has not promised to 
give.&nbsp; But when we look back, and reflect that there have 
been opportunities in which we have neglected to take up our 
cross and speak and act for God, what a dejection of mind we 
feel!&nbsp; We are then justly filled with shame.&nbsp; Conscious
of being ashamed of Christ, we cannot come with that holy 
boldness to a throne of grace, nor feel that free access when we 
make our supplications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are commanded to provoke one another to love and 
good works; and where two are agreed together in the things of 
God, they may say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And if our fellowship below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jesus be so sweet,<br />
What heights of rapture shall we know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When round the throne we meet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I hope Mrs. --- and you are both of one heart and 
one mind.&nbsp; Then you will sweetly agree in all things that 
make for your present and eternal happiness.&nbsp; Christ sent 
his disciples out, not singly, but two and two, that they might 
comfort and help each other in those ways and works which their 
Lord commanded them to pursue.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>&ldquo;It has been my lot to have been alone the 
greatest part of the time that I have known the ways of 
God.&nbsp; I therefore find it such a treat to my soul when I can
meet with any who love to talk of the goodness and love of God, 
and all his gracious dealings.&nbsp; What a comfortable 
reflection, to think of spending a whole eternity in that 
delightful employment! to tell to listening angels his love 
&lsquo;immense, unsearchable!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir, I thank you for your kindness and 
condescension in leaving those that are of high rank and birth in
the world, to converse with me, who am but a servant here 
below.&nbsp; But when I consider what a high calling, what honour
and dignity, God has conferred upon me, to be called his child, 
to be born of his Spirit, made an heir of glory, and joint heir 
with Christ; how humble and circumspect should I be in all my 
ways, as a dutiful and loving child to an affectionate and loving
Father!&nbsp; When I seriously consider these things, it fills me
with love and gratitude to God; and I do not wish for any higher 
station, nor envy the rich.&nbsp; I rather pity them, if they are
not good as well as great.&nbsp; My blessed Lord was pleased to 
appear in the form of a servant, and I long to be like him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not feel in so happy a frame of conversation that
day, nor yet that liberty to explain my thoughts which I 
sometimes do.&nbsp; The fault must have been all in myself; for 
there was nothing in you but what seemed to evidence a Christian 
spirit, temper, and disposition.&nbsp; I very much wished for an 
opportunity to converse with you.&nbsp; I feel very thankful to 
God that you do take up the cross, and despise the shame: if you 
are found faithful, you will soon sit down with him in glory.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
26</span>&ldquo;I have written to the Rev. Mr. ---, to thank him 
for permitting you to perform the burial service at --- over my 
dear departed sister, and to tell him of the kind way in which 
you consented to do it.&nbsp; I should mention that your manner 
of reading the service on that day had a considerable effect on 
the hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse all faults, and correct my errors.&nbsp; I 
expect in a few days to return home to my parents&rsquo; 
house.&nbsp; We shall rejoice to see you there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your humble servant in Christ,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was impossible to view such a correspondent with 
indifference.&nbsp; I had just returned from a little cottage 
assembly, where, on Sunday evenings, I sometimes went to instruct
a few poor families in one of the hamlets belonging to my 
parish.&nbsp; I read the letter, and closed the day with 
thanksgiving to God for thus enabling those who fear his name to 
build up each other in fear and love.</p>
<p>Of old time &ldquo;they that feared the Lord spake often one 
to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of 
remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord,
and that thought upon his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That book of remembrance is not yet closed.</p>
<h3>PART III.</h3>
<p>The mind of man is like a moving picture, supplied with 
objects not only from contemplation on things present, but from 
the fruitful sources of recollection and anticipation.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>Memory retraces past events, and restores an ideal 
reality to scenes which are gone by for ever.&nbsp; They live 
again in revived imagery, and we seem to hear and see with 
renewed emotions what we heard and saw at a former period.&nbsp; 
Successions of such recollected circumstances often form a series
of welcome memorials.&nbsp; In religious meditations, the memory 
becomes a sanctified instrument of spiritual improvement.</p>
<p>Another part of this animated picture is furnished by the 
pencil of Hope.&nbsp; She draws encouraging prospects for the 
soul, by connecting the past and the present with the 
future.&nbsp; Seeing the promises afar off, she is persuaded of 
their truth, and embraces them as her own.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God gives a blessing to both these acts of the 
mind, and employs them in the service of religion.&nbsp; Every 
faculty of body and soul, when considered as a part of &ldquo;the
purchased possession&rdquo; of the Saviour, assumes a new 
character.&nbsp; How powerfully does the apostle on this ground 
urge a plea for holy activity and watchfulness!&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your 
own?&nbsp; For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God 
in your body, and in your spirit, which are 
God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christian may derive much profit and enjoyment from the 
use of the memory as it concerns those transactions in which he 
once bore a part.&nbsp; In his endeavours to recall past 
conversations and intercourse with deceased friends, in 
particular, the powers of remembrance greatly improve by 
exercise.&nbsp; One revived idea produces another, till the mind 
is most agreeably and usefully occupied with lively and holy 
imaginations.</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>&ldquo;Lulled in the countless 
chambers of the brain,<br />
Our thoughts are linked by many a hidden chain.<br />
Awake but one, and lo! what myriads rise!<br />
Each stamps its image as the other flies.<br />
Each, as the varied avenues of sense<br />
Delight or sorrow to the soul dispense,<br />
Brightens or fades; yet all, with sacred art,<br />
Control the latent fibres of the heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May it please God to bless, both to the reader and the writer,
this feeble attempt to recollect some of the communications which
I once enjoyed in my visits to the Dairyman&rsquo;s dwelling.</p>
<p>Very soon after the receipt of the last letter, I rode for the
first time to see the family at their own house.&nbsp; The 
principal part of the road lay through retired narrow lanes, 
beautifully overarched with groves of nut and other trees, which 
screened the traveller from the rays of the sun, and afforded 
many interesting objects for admiration, in the flowers, shrubs, 
and young trees, which grew upon the high banks on each side of 
the road.&nbsp; Many grotesque rocks, with little trickling 
streams of water occasionally breaking out of them, varied the 
recluse scenery, and produced a romantic and pleasing effect.</p>
<p>Here and there the more distant prospect beyond was observable
through gaps and hollow places on the roadside.&nbsp; Lofty 
hills, with many signal-posts, obelisks, and light-houses on 
their summits, appeared at these intervals; rich cornfields were 
also visible through some of the open places; and now and then, 
when the road ascended a hill, the sea, with ships at various 
distances, was seen.&nbsp; But for the most part shady seclusion,
and objects of a more minute and confined nature, gave a 
character to the journey, and invited contemplation.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>How much do they lose who are strangers to serious 
meditation on the wonders and beauties of nature!&nbsp; How 
gloriously the God of creation shines in his works!&nbsp; Not a 
tree, or leaf, or flower, not a bird or insect, but it proclaims 
in glowing language, &ldquo;God made me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I approached the village where the good old Dairyman dwelt,
I observed him in a little field, driving his two cows before him
towards a yard and hovel which adjoined his cottage.&nbsp; I 
advanced very near him without his observing me, for his sight 
was dim.&nbsp; On my calling out to him, he started at the sound 
of my voice, but with much gladness of heart welcomed me, saying,
&ldquo;Bless your heart, sir, I am glad you are come: we have 
looked for you every day this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage door opened, and the daughter came out, followed 
by her aged and infirm mother.&nbsp; The sight of me naturally 
brought to recollection the grave at which we had before 
met.&nbsp; Tears of affection mingled with the smile of 
satisfaction with which I was received by these worthy 
cottagers.&nbsp; I dismounted and was conducted through a neat 
little garden, part of which was shaded by two large 
overspreading elm-trees, to the house.&nbsp; Decency and order 
were manifested within and without.&nbsp; No excuse was made 
here, on the score of poverty, for confusion and uncleanliness in
the disposal of their little household.&nbsp; Everything wore the
aspect of neatness and propriety.&nbsp; On each side of the 
fireplace stood an old oaken arm-chair, where the venerable 
parents rested their weary limbs after the day&rsquo;s labour was
over.&nbsp; On a shelf in one corner lay two Bibles, with a few 
religious books and tracts.&nbsp; The little room had two 
windows: a lovely prospect of hills, woods, and fields, appeared 
through <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>one; and the other was more than half
obscured by the branches of a vine which was trained across it; 
between its leaves the sun shone, and cast a cheerful light over 
the whole place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;is a fit residence for 
piety, peace, and contentment.&nbsp; May I learn a fresh lesson 
for advancement in each, through the blessing of God on this 
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the daughter, &ldquo;we are not worthy
that you should come under our roof.&nbsp; We take it very kind 
that you should travel so far to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Master,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;came a great deal 
further to visit us poor sinners.&nbsp; He left the bosom of his 
Father, laid aside his glory, and came down to this lower world 
on a visit of mercy and love; and ought not we, if we profess to 
follow him, to bear each other&rsquo;s infirmities, and go about 
doing good as he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man now entered, and joined his wife and daughter in 
giving me a cordial welcome.&nbsp; Our conversation soon turned 
to the loss they had so lately sustained.&nbsp; The pious and 
sensible disposition of the daughter was peculiarly manifested, 
as well in what she said to her parents as in what she more 
immediately addressed to myself.&nbsp; I had now a further 
opportunity of remarking the good sense and agreeable manner 
which accompanied her expressions of devotedness to God, and love
to Christ for the great mercies which he had bestowed upon 
her.&nbsp; During her residence in different gentlemen&rsquo;s 
families where she had been in service, she had acquired a 
superior behaviour and address; but sincere piety rendered her 
very humble and unassuming in manner and conversation.&nbsp; She 
seemed anxious to improve the opportunity of my visit to the best
purpose for her own and her <!-- page 31--><a 
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>parents&rsquo; sake; yet there was nothing of unbecoming
forwardness, no self-confidence or conceitedness in her 
conduct.&nbsp; She united the firmness and solicitude of the 
Christian with the modesty of the female and the dutifulness of 
the daughter.&nbsp; It was impossible to be in her company and 
not observe how truly her temper and conversation adorned the 
principles which she professed.</p>
<p>I soon discovered how eager and how successful also she had 
been in her endeavours to bring her father and mother to the 
knowledge and experience of the truth.&nbsp; This is a lovely 
feature in the character of a young Christian.&nbsp; If it have 
pleased God, in the free dispensation of his mercy, to call the 
child by his grace while the parents remain still in ignorance 
and sin, how great is the duty incumbent on that child to do what
is possible to promote the conversion of those to whom so much is
owing!&nbsp; Happy is it when the ties of grace sanctify those of
nature!</p>
<p>The aged couple evidently regarded and spoke of this daughter 
as their teacher and admonisher in divine things, while at the 
same time they received from her every token of filial submission
and obedience, testified by continual endeavours to serve and 
assist them to the utmost of her power in the daily concerns of 
the household.</p>
<p>The religion of this young woman was of a highly spiritual 
character, and of no ordinary attainment.&nbsp; Her views of the 
divine plan in saving the sinner were clear and scriptural.&nbsp;
She spoke much of the joys and sorrows which, in the course of 
her religious progress, she had experienced; but she was fully 
sensible that there is far more in real religion than mere 
occasional transition from one frame of mind and spirits to 
another.&nbsp; She believed that the experimental <!-- page 
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>acquaintance of the heart with God principally consisted
in so living upon Christ by faith as to aim at living like him by
love.&nbsp; She knew that the love of God toward the sinner, and 
the path of duty prescribed to the sinner, are both of an 
unchangeable nature.&nbsp; In a believing dependence on the one, 
and an affectionate walk in the other, she sought and found 
&ldquo;the peace of God which passeth all understanding;&rdquo; 
for &ldquo;so he giveth his beloved rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had read but few books besides her Bible; but these few 
were excellent in their kind, and she spoke of their contents as 
one who knew their value.&nbsp; In addition to a Bible and 
Prayer-book, &ldquo;Doddridge&rsquo;s Rise and Progress,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Romaine&rsquo;s Life, Walk, and Triumph of Faith,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Bunyan&rsquo;s Pilgrim,&rdquo; &ldquo;Alleine&rsquo;s 
Alarm,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baxter&rsquo;s Saint&rsquo;s Everlasting 
Rest,&rdquo; a hymn-book, and a few tracts, completed her 
library.</p>
<p>I observed in her countenance a pale and delicate hue, which I
afterwards found to be a presage of consumption; and the idea 
then occurred to me that she would not live very long.</p>
<p>Time passed on swiftly with this interesting family, and after
having partaken of some plain and wholesome refreshment, and 
enjoyed a few hours&rsquo; conversation with them, I found it was
necessary for me to return homewards.&nbsp; The disposition and 
character of the parties may be in some sort ascertained by the 
expressions at parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God send you safe home again,&rdquo; said the aged 
mother, &ldquo;and bless the day that brought you to see two poor
old creatures such as we are, in our trouble and 
affliction.&nbsp; Come again, sir, come again when you can; and 
though I am a poor ignorant soul, and not fit to talk to such a 
gentleman as you, yet my dear child shall speak for me.&nbsp; She
is the <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>greatest comfort I have left, and I 
hope the good Lord will spare her to support my trembling limbs 
and feeble spirits, till I lie down with my other dear departed 
children in the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust to the Lord,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and 
remember his gracious promise: &lsquo;Even to your old age I am 
he; and even to hoar hairs I will carry you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the daughter, &ldquo;for 
your Christian kindness to me and my friends.&nbsp; I believe the
blessing of the Lord has attended your visit, and I hope I have 
experienced it to be so.&nbsp; My dear father and mother will, I 
am sure, remember it; and I rejoice in the opportunity of seeing 
so kind a friend under this roof.&nbsp; My Saviour has been 
abundantly good to me, in plucking me as &lsquo;a brand from the 
burning,&rsquo; and showing me the way of life and peace; and I 
hope it is my heart&rsquo;s desire to live to his glory.&nbsp; 
But I long to see these dear friends enjoy the power and comfort 
of religion likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it evident,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;that the 
promise is fulfilled in their case: &lsquo;It shall come to pass 
that at evening time it shall be light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and praise God 
for the blessed hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank him, too, that you have been the happy instrument
of bringing them to the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir; yet when I think of my own unworthiness and 
insufficiency, I rejoice with trembling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the good old man, &ldquo;I am sure the
Lord will reward you for this kindness.&nbsp; Pray for us, old as
we are, and sinners as we have been, that yet he would have mercy
upon us at the eleventh hour.&nbsp; Poor Betsy strives much <!-- 
page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>for our sakes, both in body and soul: she works hard all
day to save us trouble, and I fear has not strength to support 
all she does; and then she talks to us, and reads to us, and 
prays for us, that we may be saved from the wrath to come.&nbsp; 
Indeed, sir, she&rsquo;s a rare child to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace be to you, and to all that belong to 
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen, and thank you, dear sir,&rdquo; was echoed from 
each tongue.</p>
<p>Thus we parted for that time.&nbsp; My returning meditations 
were sweet, and I hope profitable.</p>
<p>Many other visits were afterwards made by me to this peaceful 
cottage, and I always found increasing reason to thank God for 
the intercourse I there enjoyed.</p>
<p>An interval of some length occurred once during that year in 
which I had not seen the Dairyman&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; I was 
reminded of the circumstance by the receipt of the following 
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been expecting to see or hear from you for a 
considerable time.&nbsp; Excuse the liberty I take in sending you
another letter.&nbsp; I have been confined to the house the 
greater part of the time since I left ---.&nbsp; I took cold that
day, and have been worse ever since.&nbsp; I walk out a little on
these fine days, but seem to myself to walk very near the borders
of eternity.&nbsp; Glory be to God, it is a very pleasing 
prospect before me!&nbsp; Though I feel the working of sin, and 
am abased, yet Jesus shows his mercy to be mine, and I trust that
I am his.&nbsp; At such times&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My soul would leave this heavy clay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At his transporting word,<br />
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
35</span>Run up with joy the shining way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet and prove the Lord.</p>
<p>Fearless of hell and ghastly death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d break through ev&rsquo;ry foe;<br />
The wings of love and arms of faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would bear me conqu&rsquo;ror through.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My desire is to live every moment to God, that I may, through 
his grace, be kept in that heavenly, happy frame of mind, that I 
shall wish for at the hour of death.&nbsp; We cannot live or die 
happy without this; and to keep it, we must be continually 
watching and praying: for we have many enemies to disturb our 
peace.&nbsp; I am so very weak, that now I can go nowhere to any 
outward means for that help which is so refreshing to my 
spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been very happy to have heard you last 
Sunday, when you preached at ---.&nbsp; I could not walk so 
far.&nbsp; I hope the word spoken by you was made a blessing to 
many who heard it.&nbsp; It was my earnest prayer to God that it 
might be so.&nbsp; But, alas! once calling does not awaken many 
that are in a sound sleep.&nbsp; Yet the voice of God is 
sometimes very powerful, when his ministers speak; when they are 
influenced by his Holy Spirit, and are simple and sincere in 
holding forth the word of life.&nbsp; Then it will teach us all 
things, and enlighten our mind and reveal unto us the hidden 
things of darkness, and give us out of that divine treasure 
&lsquo;things new and old.&rsquo;&nbsp; Resting on God to work in
us both to will and to do of his own good pleasure, we ought 
always to work as diligent servants, that know they have a good 
Master, that will surely not forget their labour of love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could but fix our eyes always on that crown of 
glory that waits us in the skies, we should never grow weary <!--
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>in well-doing, but should run with patience and delight 
in the work and ways of God, where he appoints us.&nbsp; We 
should not then, as we too frequently do, suffer these trifling 
objects here on earth to draw away our minds from God, to rob him
of his glory and our souls of that happiness and comfort which 
the believer may enjoy amidst outward afflictions.&nbsp; If we 
thus lived more by faith in the Son of God, we should endeavour 
to stir up all whom we could to seek after God.&nbsp; We should 
tell them what he has done for us, and what he would do for them 
if they truly sought him.&nbsp; We should show them what a 
glorious expectation there is for all true believers and sincere 
seekers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our minds are so fixed on God, we are more 
desirous of glorifying him, in making known his goodness to us, 
than the proud rich man is of getting honour to himself.&nbsp; I 
mourn over my own backwardness to this exercise of duty, when I 
think of God&rsquo;s willingness to save the vilest of the vile, 
according to the dispensations of his eternal grace and 
mercy.&nbsp; Oh, how amiable, how lovely does this make that God 
of love appear to poor sinners, that can view him as such!&nbsp; 
How is the soul delighted with such a contemplation!&nbsp; They 
that have much forgiven, how much they love!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These thoughts have been much on my mind since the 
death of ---.&nbsp; I trust the Lord will pardon me for 
neglect.&nbsp; I thought it was my duty to speak or write to him:
you remember what I said to you respecting it.&nbsp; But I still 
delayed till a more convenient season.&nbsp; Oh, how I was struck
when I heard the Lord had taken him so suddenly!&nbsp; I was 
filled with sorrow and shame for having neglected what I had so 
often resolved to do.&nbsp; But now the time of speaking for God 
to him was over.&nbsp; Hence we see that the Lord&rsquo;s <!-- 
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>time is the best time.&nbsp; Now the night of death was 
come upon him; no more work was to be done.&nbsp; If I had done 
all that lay in my power to proclaim reconciliation by Christ to 
his soul, whether he had heard or no, I should have been clear of
his blood.&nbsp; But I cannot recall the time that is past, nor 
him from the grave.&nbsp; Had I known the Lord would have called 
him so suddenly, how diligent I should have been to warn him of 
his danger!&nbsp; But it is enough that God shows us what 
<i>we</i> are to do, and not what <i>he</i> is about to do with 
us or any of his creatures.&nbsp; Pray, sir, do all you can for 
the glory of God.&nbsp; The time will soon pass by, and then we 
shall enter that glorious rest that he hath prepared for them 
that love him.&nbsp; I pray God to fill you with that zeal and 
love which he only can inspire, that you may daily win souls to 
Christ.&nbsp; May he deliver you from all slavish fear of man, 
and give you boldness, as he did of old those that were filled 
with the Holy Ghost and with power!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Christ has promised to be with all his 
faithful ministers to the end of time.&nbsp; The greater dangers 
and difficulties they are exposed to, the more powerful his 
assistance.&nbsp; Then, sir, let us fear none but him.&nbsp; I 
hope you will pray much for me, a poor sinner, that God will 
perfect his strength in my weakness of body and mind; for without
him I can do nothing.&nbsp; But when I can experience the 
teaching of that Holy One, I need no other teacher.&nbsp; May the
Lord anoint you with the same, and give you every grace of his 
Holy Spirit, that you may be filled with all the fulness of God; 
that you may know what is the height and depth, the length and 
breadth, of the love of God in Christ Jesus; that you may be in 
the hand of the Lord as a keen archer to draw the bow, while the 
Lord directs and fastens <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the arrows of
conviction in the hearts of such as are under your ministry!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely pray that you may be made a blessing to him
that has taken the place of the deceased.&nbsp; I have heard that
you are fellow-countrymen: I hope you are, however, both as 
strangers in this world, that have no abiding place, but seek a 
country out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse all faults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your humble servant in the bonds of the gospel of 
Christ,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I perused this and other letters, which were at different
times written to me by the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, I felt that
in the person of this interesting correspondent were singularly 
united the characters of a humble disciple and a faithful 
monitor.&nbsp; I wished to acknowledge the goodness of God in 
each of these her capacities.</p>
<p>I sometimes entertain a hope that the last day will unfold the
value of these epistolary communications, beyond even any present
estimate of their spiritual importance.</p>
<h3>PART IV.</h3>
<p>The translation of sinners &ldquo;from the power of darkness 
into the kingdom of God&rsquo;s dear Son,&rdquo; is the joy of 
Christians and the admiration of angels.&nbsp; Every penitent and
pardoned soul is a new witness to the triumphs of the Redeemer 
over sin, death, and the grave.&nbsp; How great the change that 
is wrought!&nbsp; The child of wrath becomes a <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>monument of 
grace&mdash;a brand plucked from the burning!&nbsp; &ldquo;If any
man be in Christ he is a new creature: old things are passed 
away; behold, all things are become new.&rdquo;&nbsp; How 
marvellous, how interesting, is the spiritual history of each 
individual believer!&nbsp; He is, like David, &ldquo;a wonder to 
many,&rdquo; but the greatest wonder of all to himself.&nbsp; 
Others may doubt whether it be so or not; but to <i>him</i> it is
unequivocally proved, that, from first to last, grace alone 
reigns in the work of his salvation.</p>
<p>The character and privileges of real Christians are 
beautifully described in the language of our church; which, when 
speaking of the objects of divine favour and compassion, says: 
&ldquo;They that be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be
called according to God&rsquo;s purpose in due season: they 
through grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be
made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his 
only begotten Son, Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good 
works; and at length, by God&rsquo;s mercy, they attain to 
everlasting felicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a conception and display of the almighty wisdom, power, 
and love, is indeed &ldquo;full of sweet, pleasant, and 
unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in 
themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ mortifying the 
works of the flesh and their earthly members, and drawing up 
their minds to high and heavenly things: it doth greatly 
establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation, to be 
enjoyed through Christ, and doth fervently kindle their love 
towards God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly allied to the consolation of a good hope through grace,
as it respects our own personal state before God, is that of 
seeing its evidences shed lustre over the disposition <!-- page 
40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and 
conduct of others.&nbsp; Bright was the exhibition of the union 
between true Christian enjoyment and Christian exertion, in the 
character whose moral and spiritual features I am attempting to 
delineate.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the first wish of her heart to prove to 
others, what God had already proved to her, that Jesus is 
&ldquo;the way, and the truth, and the life.&rdquo;&nbsp; She 
desired to evince the reality of her calling, justification, and 
adoption into the family of God, by showing a conformity to the 
image of Christ, and by walking &ldquo;religiously in good 
works:&rdquo; she trusted that, in this path of faith and 
obedience, she should &ldquo;at length, by God&rsquo;s mercy, 
attain to everlasting felicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had the spiritual charge of another parish, adjoining to 
that in which I resided.&nbsp; It was a small district, and had 
but few inhabitants.&nbsp; The church was pleasantly situated on 
a rising bank, at the foot of a considerable hill.&nbsp; It was 
surrounded by trees, and had a rural, retired appearance.&nbsp; 
Close to the church-yard stood a large old mansion, which had 
formerly been the residence of an opulent and titled family; but 
it had long since been appropriated to the use of the estate as a
farm-house.&nbsp; Its outward aspect bore considerable remains of
ancient grandeur, and gave a pleasing character to the spot of 
ground on which the church stood.</p>
<p>In every direction the roads that led to this house of God 
possessed distinct but interesting features.&nbsp; One of them 
ascended between several rural cottages, from the sea-shore, 
which adjoined the lower part of the village street.&nbsp; 
Another winded round the curved sides of the adjacent hill, and 
was adorned, both above and below, with numerous sheep, feeding 
on the herbage of the down.&nbsp; A third road led to the church 
by a gently rising approach between high <!-- page 41--><a 
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>banks, 
covered with young trees, bushes, ivy, hedge-plants, and wild 
flowers.</p>
<p>From a point of land which commanded a view of all these 
several avenues, I used sometimes for a while to watch my 
congregation gradually assembling together at the hour of Sabbath
worship.&nbsp; They were in some directions visible for a 
considerable distance.&nbsp; Gratifying associations of thought 
would form in my mind, as I contemplated their approach, and 
successive arrival, within the precincts of the house of 
prayer.</p>
<p>One day as I was thus occupied, during a short interval 
previous to the hour of divine service, I reflected on the joy 
which David experienced at the time he exclaimed: &ldquo;I was 
glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the 
Lord.&nbsp; Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O 
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact 
together; whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto 
the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the 
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was led to reflect upon the various blessings connected with
the establishment of public worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many 
immortal souls are now gathering together to perform the 
all-important work of prayer and praise&mdash;to hear the word of
God&mdash;to feed upon the bread of life!&nbsp; They are leaving 
their respective dwellings, and will soon be united together in 
the house of prayer.&nbsp; How beautifully does this represent 
the effect produced by the voice of the &lsquo;Good 
Shepherd,&rsquo; calling his sheep from every part of the 
wilderness into his fold!&nbsp; As these fields, hills, and 
lanes, are now covered with men, women, and children, in various 
directions, drawing nearer to each other, and to the object of 
their journey&rsquo;s <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>end; even so, &lsquo;many shall come 
from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from 
the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of 
God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can rightly appreciate the value of such hours as 
these?&mdash;hours spent in learning the ways of holy 
pleasantness and the paths of heavenly peace&mdash;hours devoted 
to the service of God and of souls; in warning the sinner to flee
from the wrath to come; in teaching the ignorant how to live and 
die; in preaching the gospel to the poor; in healing the 
broken-hearted; in declaring &ldquo;deliverance to the captives, 
and recovering of sight to the blind.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed
is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O 
Lord, in the light of thy countenance.&nbsp; In thy name they 
shall rejoice all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be
exalted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My thoughts then pursued a train of reflection on the 
importance of the ministerial office, as connected in the 
purposes of God with the salvation of sinners.&nbsp; I inwardly 
prayed that those many individuals whom he had given me to 
instruct, might not, through my neglect or error, be as sheep 
having no shepherd, nor as the blind led by the blind; but rather
that I might, in season and out of season, faithfully proclaim 
the simple and undisguised truths of the gospel, to the glory of 
God and the prosperity of his church.</p>
<p>At that instant, near the bottom of the enclosed lane which 
led to the church-yard, I observed a friend, whom, at such a 
distance from his home, I little expected to meet.&nbsp; It was 
the venerable Dairyman.&nbsp; He came up the ascent, leaning with
one hand on his trusty staff, and with the other on the arm of a 
younger man, well known to me, who appeared <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>to be much 
gratified in meeting with such a companion by the way.</p>
<p>My station was on the top of one of the banks which formed the
hollow road beneath.&nbsp; They passed a few yards below 
me.&nbsp; I was concealed from their sight by a projecting 
tree.&nbsp; They were talking of the mercies of God, and the 
unsearchable riches of his grace.&nbsp; The Dairyman was telling 
his companion what a blessing the Lord had given him in his 
daughter.&nbsp; His countenance brightened as he named her, and 
called her his precious Betsy.</p>
<p>I met them at a stile not many yards beyond, and accompanied 
them to the church, which was hard by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I have brought a 
letter from my daughter, I hope I am in time for divine 
service.&nbsp; Seven miles has now become a long walk for me: I 
grow old and weak.&nbsp; I am very glad to see you, 
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poorly indeed, sir,&mdash;very poorly.&nbsp; The 
doctors say it is a decline.&nbsp; I sometimes hope she will get 
the better of it; but then again I have many fears.&nbsp; You 
know, sir, that I have cause to love and prize her.&nbsp; Oh, it 
would be such a trial! but the Lord knows what is best.&nbsp; 
Excuse my weakness, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a letter into my hand, the perusal of which I reserved 
till afterwards, as the time was nigh for going into church.</p>
<p>The presence of this aged pilgrim, the peculiar reverence and 
affection with which he joined in the different parts of the 
service, excited many gratifying thoughts in my mind, such as 
rather furthered than interrupted devotion.</p>
<p>The train of reflection in which I had been engaged when <!-- 
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>I first discovered him on the road, at intervals 
recurred powerfully to my feelings, as I viewed that very 
congregation assembled together in the house of God, whose steps,
in their approach towards it, I had watched with prayerful 
emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the rich and poor meet together in mutual 
acknowledgment that the Lord is the maker of them all; and that 
all are alike dependent creatures, looking up to one common 
Father to supply their wants, both temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, likewise, will they meet together in the grave, 
that undistinguished receptacle of the opulent and the needy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And once more, at the judgment-seat of Christ shall the
rich and the poor meet together, that &lsquo;every one may 
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath 
done, whether it be good or bad.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How closely connected in the history of man are these 
three periods of a general meeting together?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house of prayer&mdash;the house appointed for all 
living&mdash;and the house not made with hands, eternal in the 
heavens.&nbsp; May we never separate these ideas from each other,
but retain them in a sacred and profitable union!&nbsp; So shall 
our worshipping assemblies on earth be representative of the 
general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written 
in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the congregation dispersed, I entered into discourse with
the Dairyman and a few of the poor of my flock, whose minds were 
of the like disposition to his own.&nbsp; He seldom could speak 
long together without some reference to his dear child.&nbsp; He 
loved to tell how merciful his <!-- page 45--><a 
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>God had been 
to him, in the dutiful and affectionate attentions of his 
daughter.&nbsp; All real Christians feel a tender spiritual 
attachment towards those who have been the instrument of bringing
them to an effectual knowledge of the way of salvation; but when 
that instrument is one so nearly allied, how dear does the 
relationship become!</p>
<p>If my friend the Dairyman was in any danger of falling into 
idolatry, his child would have been the idol of his 
affections.&nbsp; She was the prop and stay of her parents&rsquo;
declining years, and they scarcely knew how sufficiently to 
testify the gratitude of their hearts for the comfort and 
blessing which she was the means of affording them.</p>
<p>While he was relating several particulars of his family 
history to the others, I opened and read the following 
letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more I take the liberty to trouble you with a few 
lines.&nbsp; I received your letter with great pleasure, and 
thank you for it.&nbsp; I am now so weak that I am unable to walk
to any public place of divine worship,&mdash;a privilege which 
has heretofore always so much strengthened and refreshed 
me.&nbsp; I used to go in anxious expectation to meet my God, and
hold sweet communion with him; and I was seldom 
disappointed.&nbsp; In the means of grace all the channels of 
divine mercy are open to every heart that is lifted up to receive
out of that divine fulness grace for grace.&nbsp; These are the 
times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord.&nbsp; How have
I rejoiced to hear a faithful and lively messenger, just come, as
it were, from communion with God at the throne of grace, with his
heart warmed and filled with divine love, <!-- page 46--><a 
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>to speak to 
fallen sinners!&nbsp; Such a one has seemed to me as if his face 
shone as that of Moses did with the glory of God, when he came 
down from the mount, where he had been within the veil.&nbsp; May
you, sir, imitate him, as he did Christ, that all may see and 
know that the Lord dwelleth with you, and that you dwell in him 
through the unity of the blessed Spirit.&nbsp; I trust you are no
stranger to his divine teaching, aid, and assistance, in all you 
set your hand to do for the glory of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, the sincerity of my wishes for your 
spiritual welfare will plead an excuse for the freedom of my 
address to you.&nbsp; I pray the Giver of every perfect gift, 
that you may experience the mighty workings of his gracious 
Spirit in your heart and your ministry, and rest your all on the 
justifying and purifying blood of an expired Redeemer.&nbsp; Then
will you triumph in his strength, and be enabled to say with the 
poet,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I, through fear of feeble man,<br />
The Spirit&rsquo;s course strive to restrain;<br />
Or, undismayed in deed and word,<br />
Be a true witness for my Lord?</p>
<p>Awed by a mortal&rsquo;s frown shall I<br />
Conceal the word of God most high?<br />
How then before thee shall I dare<br />
To stand, or how thine anger bear?</p>
<p>Shall I, to soothe the unholy throng,<br />
Soften thy truths and smooth my tongue,<br />
To gain earth&rsquo;s gilded toys, or flee<br />
The cross endured, my God, by thee?</p>
<p>What then is he whose scorn I dread.<br />
Whose wrath or hate makes me afraid?<br />
A man? an heir of death? a slave<br />
To sin? a bubble on the wave?</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>Yea, let men rage, since thou wilt spread<br />
Thy shadowing wings around my head:<br />
Since in all pain thy tender love<br />
Will still my sure refreshment prove.</p>
<p>Still shall the love of Christ restrain<br />
To seek the wand&rsquo;ring souls of men,<br />
With cries, entreaties, tears to save,<br />
And snatch them from the yawning grave.</p>
<p>For this let men revile my name,&mdash;<br />
No cross I shun, I fear no shame:<br />
All hail reproach, and welcome pain;<br />
Only thy terrors, Lord, restrain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust, sir, that you see what a glorious high calling
yours is, and that you are one of those who walk humbly with God,
that you may be taught of him in all things.&nbsp; Persons in 
your place are messengers of the most high God.&nbsp; Is it too 
much to say, they should live like the angels in all holiness, 
and be filled with love and zeal for men&rsquo;s souls?&nbsp; 
They are ambassadors, in Christ&rsquo;s stead, to persuade 
sinners to be reconciled to God.&nbsp; So that your calling is 
above that of angels: for they are <i>afterwards</i> to minister 
to the heirs of salvation; but the sinner must be <i>first</i> 
reconciled to God.&nbsp; And you are called on from day to day to
intercede with man as his friend, that you may win souls to 
Christ.&nbsp; Christ is ascended up on high, to intercede with 
his Father for guilty sinners, and to plead for them the merits 
of his death.&nbsp; So that Christ and his faithful ministers, 
through the operation of the blessed Spirit, are co-workers 
together.&nbsp; Yet without him we can do nothing: our strength 
is his strength, and his is all the glory from first to last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my heart&rsquo;s prayer and desire, sir, that you
may, by a living faith, cleave close to that blessed, exalted 
Lamb of <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>God, who died to redeem us from 
sin&mdash;that you may have a sweet communion with Father, Son, 
and Spirit&mdash;that you may sink deep in humble love, and rise 
high in the life of God.&nbsp; Thus will you have such 
discoveries of the beauties of Christ and his eternal glory as 
will fill your heart with true delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am not deceived, I wish myself to enjoy his 
gracious favour, more than all the treasures which earth can 
afford.&nbsp; I would in comparison look upon them with holy 
disdain, and as not worth an anxious thought, that they may not 
have power on my heart to draw or attract it from God, who is 
worthy of my highest esteem, and of all my affections.&nbsp; It 
should be our endeavour to set him always before us, that in all 
things we may act as in his immediate presence; that we may be 
filled with that holy fear, so that we may not dare wilfully to 
sin against him.&nbsp; We should earnestly entreat the Lord to 
mortify the power and working of sin and unbelief within us, by 
making Christ appear more and more precious in our eyes, and more
dear to our hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It fills my heart with thankful recollections, while I 
attempt in this weak manner to speak of God&rsquo;s love to 
man.&nbsp; When I reflect on my past sins and his past mercies, I
am assured, that if I had all the gifts of wise men and angels, I
could never sufficiently describe my own inward sense of his 
undeserved love towards me.&nbsp; We can better enjoy these 
glorious apprehensions in our hearts than explain them to 
others.&nbsp; But, oh, how unworthy of them are we all!&nbsp; 
Consciousness of my own corruptions keeps me often low; yet faith
and desire will easily mount on high, beseeching God that he 
would, according to the apostle&rsquo;s prayer, fill me with <!--
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>all his communicable fulness, in the gifts and graces of
his Spirit; that I may walk well-pleasing before him, in all holy
conversation, perfecting holiness in his fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I err in boldness, sir, pray pardon me, and in your 
next letter confirm my hope that you will be my counsellor and 
guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only recompense your kindness to me by my 
prayers, that your own intercourse with God may be abundantly 
blessed to you and yours.&nbsp; I consider the Saviour saying to 
you, as he did to Peter, &lsquo;Lovest thou me?&rsquo;&nbsp; And 
may your heartfelt experience be compelled to reply, &lsquo;Thou 
knowest all things, and thou knowest that I love thee&rsquo; 
supremely!&nbsp; May he have evident marks of it in all your 
outward actions of love and humanity in feeding his flock, and in
the inward fervour and affection of all your consecrated powers: 
that you may be zealously engaged in pulling down the strongholds
of sin and Satan, and building up his Church; sowing the seeds of
righteousness, and praying God to give the increase: that you may
not labour for him in vain, but may see the trees bud and 
blossom, and bring forth fruit abundantly, to the praise and 
glory of your heavenly Master.&nbsp; In order to give you 
encouragement, he says, whosoever &lsquo;converteth a sinner from
the error of his way shall save a soul from death;&rsquo; and 
that will increase the brightness of your crown in glory.&nbsp; 
This hath Christ merited for his faithful ministers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, you will receive grace to be sincere in 
reproving sin, wherever you see it.&nbsp; You will find divine 
assistance, and all fear and shame taken from you.&nbsp; Great 
peace will be given to you, and wisdom, strength, and courage, 
according to your work.&nbsp; You will be as Paul; <!-- page 
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>having much learning, you can speak to men in all 
stations in life, by God&rsquo;s assistance.&nbsp; The fear of 
offending them will never prevent you, when you consider the 
glory of God; and man&rsquo;s immortal soul is of more value than
his present favour and esteem.&nbsp; In particular, you are in an
office wherein you can visit <i>all</i> the sick.&nbsp; 
Man&rsquo;s extremity is often God&rsquo;s opportunity.&nbsp; In 
this way you may prove an instrument in his hand to do his 
work.&nbsp; Although he <i>can</i> work without means, yet his 
usual way is by means; and I trust you are a chosen vessel unto 
him, to prove his name and declare his truth to all men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visiting the sick is a strict command, and a duty for 
every Christian.&nbsp; None can tell what good may be done.&nbsp;
I wish it was never neglected, as it too often is.&nbsp; Many 
think that if they attend in the church, the minister to preach, 
and the people to hear, their duty is done.&nbsp; But more is 
required than this.&nbsp; May the Lord stir up the gift that is 
in his people and ministers, that they may have compassion on 
their fellow-sinners,&mdash;that they may never think it too 
late, but remember that while there is life there is 
hope!&rdquo;&nbsp; Once more I pray, sir, pardon and excuse all 
my errors in judgment, and the ignorance that this is penned in; 
and may God bless you in all things, and particularly your 
friendship to me and my parents.&nbsp; What a comfort is family 
religion!&nbsp; I do not doubt but this is your desire, as it is 
mine, to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I and my house will serve the Lord,<br />
But first obedient to his word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I must myself appear;<br />
By actions, words, and tempers show<br />
That I my heavenly Master know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And serve with heart sincere.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>I must the fair example set;<br />
From those that on my pleasure wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stumbling-block remove;<br />
Their duty by my life explain,<br />
And still in all my works maintain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dignity of love.</p>
<p>Easy to be entreated, mild,<br />
Quickly appeased and reconciled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower of my God:<br />
A saint indeed I long to be,<br />
And lead my faithful family<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the celestial road.</p>
<p>Lord, if thou dost the wish infuse,<br />
A vessel fitted for thy use<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into thy hands receive:<br />
Work in me both to will and do,<br />
And show them how believers true<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And real Christians live.</p>
<p>With all sufficient grace supply,<br />
And then I&rsquo;ll come to testify<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wonders of thy name,<br />
Which saves from sin, the world, and hell:<br />
Its power may every sinner feel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every tongue proclaim!</p>
<p>Cleansed by the blood of Christ from sin,<br />
I seek my relatives to win,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And preach their sins forgiven;<br />
Children, and wife, and servants seize,<br />
And through the paths of pleasantness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct them all to heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living so much in a solitary way, books are my 
companions; and poetry which speaks of the love of God and the 
mercies of Christ is very sweet to my mind.&nbsp; This must be my
excuse for troubling you to read verses which others <!-- page 
52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>have 
written.&nbsp; I have intended, if my declining state of health 
permit, to go to --- for a few days.&nbsp; I say this lest you 
should call in expectation of seeing me during any part of next 
week.&nbsp; But my dear father and mother, for whose precious 
souls I am very anxious, will reap the benefit of your visit at 
all events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your humble and unworthy servant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having read it, I said to the father of my highly valued 
correspondent,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for being the bearer of this letter.&nbsp; 
Your daughter is a kind friend and faithful counsellor to me, as 
well as to you.&nbsp; Tell her how highly I esteem her 
friendship, and that I feel truly obliged for the many excellent 
sentiments which she has here expressed.&nbsp; Give her my 
blessing, and assure her that the oftener she writes the more 
thankful I shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dairyman&rsquo;s enlivened eye gleamed with pleasure as I 
spoke.&nbsp; The praise of his Elizabeth was a string which could
not be touched without causing every nerve of his whole frame to 
vibrate.</p>
<p>His voice half faltered as he spoke in reply; the tear started
in his eyes; his hand trembled as I pressed it; his heart was 
full; he could only say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, a poor old man thanks you for your kindness to him
and his family.&nbsp; God bless you, sir; I hope we shall soon 
see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we parted for that day.</p>

53</span>PART V.</h3>
<p>It has not unfrequently been observed, that when it is the 
Lord&rsquo;s pleasure to remove any of his faithful followers out
of this life at an early period of their course, they make rapid 
progress in the experience of divine truth.&nbsp; The fruits of 
the Spirit ripen fast as they advance to the close of mortal 
existence.&nbsp; In particular, they grow in humility, through a 
deeper sense of inward corruption and a clearer view of the 
perfect character of the Saviour.&nbsp; Disease and bodily 
weakness make the thoughts of eternity recur with frequency and 
power.&nbsp; The great question of their own personal salvation, 
the quality of their faith, the sincerity of their love, and the 
purity of their hope, are in continual exercise.</p>
<p>Unseen realities at such a time occupy a larger portion of 
thought than before.&nbsp; The state of existence beyond the 
grave, the invisible world, the unalterable character of the 
dead, the future judgment, the total separation from everything 
earthly, the dissolution of body and spirit, and their re-union 
at the solemn hour of resurrection&mdash;these are subjects for 
their meditation, which call for serious earnestness of 
soul.&nbsp; Whatever consolations from the Spirit of God they may
have enjoyed heretofore, they become now doubly anxious to 
examine and prove themselves whether they be indeed in the 
faith.&nbsp; In doing this, they sometimes pass through hidden 
conflicts of a dark and distressing nature; from which, however, 
they come forth like gold tried in the furnace.&nbsp; Awhile they
may sow in tears, but soon they reap in joy.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>Their religious feelings have then, perhaps, less of 
ecstasy, but more of serenity.</p>
<p>As the ears of corn ripen for the harvest, they bow their 
heads nearer to the ground.&nbsp; So it is with believers: they 
then see more than ever of their own imperfection, and often 
express their sense of it in strong language; yet they repose 
with a growing confidence on the love of God through Christ 
Jesus.&nbsp; The nearer they advance to their eternal rest, the 
more humble they become, but not the less useful in their 
sphere.&nbsp; They feel anxiously desirous of improving every 
talent they possess to the glory of God, knowing that the time is
short.</p>
<p>I thought I observed the truth of these remarks fulfilled in 
the progressive state of mind of the Dairyman&rsquo;s 
daughter.</p>
<p>Declining health seemed to indicate the will of God concerning
her.&nbsp; But her character, conduct, and experience of the 
Divine favour, increased in brightness as the setting sun of her 
mortal life approached its horizon.&nbsp; The last letter which, 
with the exception of a very short note, I ever received from 
her, I shall now transcribe.&nbsp; It appeared to me to bear the 
marks of a still deeper acquaintance with the workings of her own
heart, and a more entire reliance upon the free mercy of God.</p>
<p>The original, while I copy it, strongly revives the image of 
the deceased, and the many profitable conversations which I once 
enjoyed in her company, and that of her parents.&nbsp; It again 
endears to me the recollections of cottage piety, and helps me to
anticipate the joys of that day when the spirits of the glorified
saints shall be re-united to their bodies, and be for ever with 
the Lord.</p>
<p>The writer of this and the preceding letters herself little 
<!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>imagined, when they were penned, that they would ever be
submitted to the public eye; that they now are so, results from a
conviction that the friends of the pious poor will estimate them 
according to their value; and a hope that it may please God to 
honour these memorials of the dead, to the effectual edification 
of the living.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;In consequence of your kind permission, I take the 
liberty to trouble you with another of my ill-written letters; 
and I trust you have too much of your blessed Master&rsquo;s 
lowly, meek, and humble mind, to be offended with a poor, simple,
ignorant creature, whose intentions are pure and sincere in 
writing.&nbsp; My desire is, that I, a weak vessel of his grace, 
may glorify his name for his goodness towards me.&nbsp; May the 
Lord direct me by his counsel and wisdom!&nbsp; May he overshadow
me with his presence, that I may sit beneath the banner of his 
love, and find the consolations of his blessed Spirit sweet and 
refreshing to my soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I feel that I am nothing, and God is all in all, 
then I can willingly fly to him, saying, &lsquo;Lord, help me; 
Lord, teach me; be unto me my prophet, priest, and king.&nbsp; 
Let me know the teaching of thy grace, and the disclosing of thy 
love.&rsquo;&nbsp; What nearness of access might we have, if we 
lived more near to God!&nbsp; What sweet communion might we have 
with a God of love!&nbsp; He is the great I AM.&nbsp; How 
glorious a name!&nbsp; Angels with trembling awe prostrate 
themselves before him, and in humble love adore and worship 
him.&nbsp; One says&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While the first archangel sings,<br />
He hides his face behind his wings.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>Unworthy as I am, I have found it by experience that the
more I see of the greatness and goodness of God, and the nearer 
union I hope I have had with him through the Spirit of his love, 
the more humble and self-abased I have been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But every day I may say, &lsquo;Lord, how little I love
thee, how far I live from thee, how little am I like thee in 
humility!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is, nevertheless, my heart&rsquo;s 
desire to love and serve him better.&nbsp; I find the way in 
which God does more particularly bless me, is when I attend on 
the public ordinances of religion.&nbsp; These are the channels 
through which he conveys the riches of his grace and precious 
love to my soul.&nbsp; These I have often found to be indeed the 
time of refreshing and strengthening from the presence of the 
Lord.&nbsp; Then I can see my hope of an interest in the covenant
of his love, and praise him for his mercy to the greatest of 
sinners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I earnestly wish to be more established in his ways, 
and to honour him in the path of duty, whilst I enjoy the smiles 
of his favour.&nbsp; In the midst of all outward afflictions I 
pray that I may know Christ and the power of his resurrection 
within my soul.&nbsp; If I were always thus, my summer would last
all the year; my will would then be sweetly lost in God&rsquo;s 
will, and I should feel a resignation in every dispensation of 
his providence and his grace, saying, &lsquo;Good is the will of 
the Lord: Infinite Wisdom cannot err.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then would 
patience have its perfect work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, alas! sin and unbelief often, too often, interrupt
these frames, and lay me low before God in tears of sorrow.&nbsp;
I often think what a happiness it would be if his love were so 
fixed in my heart that I might willingly obey him with <!-- page 
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>alacrity and delight, and gradually mortify the power of
self-will, passion, and pride.&nbsp; This can only arise from a 
good hope through grace that we are washed in that precious blood
which cleanses us from every sinful stain, and makes us new 
creatures in Christ.&nbsp; Oh that we may be the happy witnesses 
of the saving power and virtue of that healing stream which flows
from the fountain of everlasting love!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, my faith is often exceedingly weak: can you be so 
kind as to tell me what you have found to be the most effectual 
means of strengthening it?&nbsp; I often think how plainly the 
Lord declares, &lsquo;Believe only, and thou shalt be 
saved.&nbsp; Only have faith; all things are possible to him that
has it.&rsquo;&nbsp; How I wish that we could remove all those 
mountains that hinder and obstruct the light of his grace; so 
that, having full access unto God through that ever-blessed 
Spirit, we might lovingly commune with him as with the dearest of
friends.&nbsp; What favour does God bestow on worms!&nbsp; And 
yet we love to murmur and complain.&nbsp; He may well say, 
&lsquo;What should I have done more, that I have not done? or 
wherein have I proved unfaithful or unkind to my faithless, 
backsliding children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I pray that I may not grieve him, as I have done, 
any more.&nbsp; I want your counsel and your prayers for me in 
this matter.&nbsp; How refreshing is the sight of one that truly 
loves God, that bears his image and likeness!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But delightful as is conversation with true believers 
on earth, whose hearts are lifted up to things above, yet what is
this to that happy day which will admit us into more bright 
realms; where we shall for ever behold a God of love in the 
smiling face of his Son, who is the express image of his Father 
and the brightness of his glory!&nbsp; Then, if found <!-- page 
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>in 
him, we shall be received by the innumerable host of angels who 
wait around his throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, sir, may I take up my cross, and 
manfully fight under Him who, for the glory that was set before 
him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is now set down 
at his Father&rsquo;s right hand in majesty.&nbsp; I thank you 
for the kind liberty you have given me of writing to you.&nbsp; I
feel my health declining, and I find a relief, during an hour of 
pain and weakness, in communicating these thoughts to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, you go on your way rejoicing; that you are
enabled to thank Him who is the giver of every good gift, 
spiritual, temporal, and providential, for blessings to yourself 
and your ministry.&nbsp; I do not doubt but you often meet with 
circumstances which are not pleasing to nature; yet, by the 
blessing of God, they will be all profitable in the end.&nbsp; 
They are kindly designed by grace to make and keep us 
humble.&nbsp; The difficulties which you spoke of to me some time
since will, I trust, disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear father and mother are as well as usual in 
bodily health; and, I hope, grow in grace, and in the knowledge 
and love of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; My chief desire to live is for 
their sakes.&nbsp; It now seems long since we have seen 
you.&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to request you to come to our 
little cottage, to visit those who are so much below your station
in life.&nbsp; But if you cannot come, we shall be very glad if 
you will write a few lines.&nbsp; I ought to make an excuse for 
my letter, I spell so badly: this was a great neglect when I was 
young.&nbsp; I gave myself greatly to reading, but not to the 
other, and now I am too weak and feeble to learn much.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
59</span>&ldquo;I hear sometimes of persons growing serious in 
your congregation: it gives me joy; and, if true, I am sure it 
does so to yourself.&nbsp; I long for the pure gospel of Christ 
to be preached in every church in the world, and for the time 
when all shall know, love, and fear the Lord; and the uniting 
Spirit of God shall make them of one heart and mind in Christ our
great head.&nbsp; Your greatest joy, I know, will be in labouring
much for the glory of God in the salvation of men&rsquo;s 
souls.&nbsp; You serve a good Master.&nbsp; You have a sure 
reward.&nbsp; I pray God to give you strength according to your 
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, do not be offended at the freedom and manner
of my writing.&nbsp; My parents&rsquo; duty and love to you are 
sent with these lines from</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your humble servant in Christ,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epistolary communications, when written in sincerity of heart,
afford genuine portraits of the mind.&nbsp; May the foregoing be 
viewed with Christian candour, and consecrated to affectionate 
memory!</p>
<h3>PART VI.</h3>
<p>Travellers, as they pass through the country, usually stop to 
inquire whose are the splendid mansions which they discover among
the woods and plains around them.&nbsp; The families, titles, 
fortune, or character of the respective owners, engage much 
attention.&nbsp; Perhaps their houses are exhibited to the 
admiring stranger.&nbsp; The elegant rooms, <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>costly 
furniture, valuable paintings, beautiful gardens and shrubberies,
are universally approved; while the rank, fashion, taste, and 
riches of the possessor, afford ample materials for entertaining 
discussion.&nbsp; In the meantime, the lowly cottage of the poor 
husbandman is passed by as scarcely deserving of notice.&nbsp; 
Yet, perchance, such a cottage may often contain a treasure of 
infinitely more value than the sumptuous palace of the rich 
man&mdash;even &ldquo;the pearl of great price.&rdquo;&nbsp; If 
this be set in the heart of the poor cottager, it proves a gem of
unspeakable worth, and will shine among the brightest ornaments 
of the Redeemer&rsquo;s crown, in that day when he maketh up his 
&ldquo;jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence the Christian traveller, while in common with others he 
bestows his due share of applause on the decorations of the rich,
and is not insensible to the beauties and magnificence which are 
the lawfully allowed appendages of rank and fortune, cannot 
overlook the humbler dwelling of the poor.&nbsp; And if he should
find that true piety and grace beneath the thatched roof which he
has in vain looked for amidst the worldly grandeur of the rich, 
he remembers the declarations in the word of God.&nbsp; He sees 
with admiration that the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth 
eternity, whose name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy 
place, dwelleth with <i>him also</i> that is of a contrite and 
humble spirit (Isa. lvii. 15); and although heaven is his throne,
and the earth his footstool, yet, when a house is to be built and
a place of rest to be sought for himself, he says, &ldquo;To this
man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite 
spirit, and trembleth at my word&rdquo; (Isa. lxvi. 2).</p>
<p>When a house is thus tenanted, Faith beholds this inscription 
written on the walls, <i>The Lord lives here</i>.&nbsp; Faith, 
<!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>therefore, cannot pass it by unnoticed, but loves to 
lift up the latch of the door, and to sit down and converse with 
the poor, although perhaps despised, inhabitant.&nbsp; Many a 
sweet interview does Faith obtain, when she thus takes her walks 
abroad.&nbsp; Many such a sweet interview have I myself enjoyed 
beneath the roof where dwelt the Dairyman and his little 
family.</p>
<p>I soon perceived that his daughter&rsquo;s health was rapidly 
on the decline.&nbsp; The pale, wasting consumption, which is the
Lord&rsquo;s instrument for removing so many thousands every year
from the land of the living made hasty strides on her 
constitution.&nbsp; The hollow eye, the distressing cough, and 
the often too flattering flush on the cheek, foretold the 
approach of death.</p>
<p>What a field for usefulness and affectionate attention, on the
part of ministers and Christian friends, is opened by the 
frequent attacks and lingering process of <i>consumptive</i> 
illness!&nbsp; How many such precious opportunities are daily 
lost, where Providence seems in so marked a way to afford time 
and space for serious and godly instruction!&nbsp; Of how many 
may it be said, &ldquo;The way of peace have they not 
known!&rdquo; for not one friend ever came nigh, to warn them to 
&ldquo;flee from the wrath to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter was happily made acquainted 
with the things which belonged to her everlasting peace, before 
the present disease had taken root in her constitution.&nbsp; In 
my visits to her, I went rather to receive information than to 
impart it.&nbsp; Her mind was abundantly stored with divine 
truths, and her conversation was truly edifying.&nbsp; The 
recollection of it will ever produce a thankful sensation in my 
heart.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>I one day received a short note to the following 
effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very glad, if your convenience will allow, 
that you will come and see a poor unworthy sinner.&nbsp; My 
hour-glass is nearly run out, but I hope I can see Christ to be 
precious to my soul.&nbsp; Your conversation has often been 
blessed to me, and I now feel the need of it more than 
ever.&nbsp; My father and mother send their duty to you.&nbsp; 
From</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your obedient and unworthy servant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E--- W---.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I obeyed the summons that same afternoon.&nbsp; On my arrival 
at the Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage, his wife opened the door.&nbsp; 
The tears streamed down her cheek, as she silently shook her 
head.&nbsp; Her heart was full.&nbsp; She tried to speak, but 
could not.&nbsp; I took her by the hand, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend, all is right, and as the Lord of wisdom
and mercy directs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Betsy, my dear girl, is so bad, sir.&nbsp; What 
shall I do without her?&nbsp; I thought I should have gone first 
to the grave; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Lord sees good that, before you die yourself 
you should behold your child safe home to glory.&nbsp; Is there 
no mercy in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear sir!&nbsp; I am very old and very weak; and 
she is a dear child, the staff and prop of a poor old creature as
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I advanced, I saw Elizabeth sitting by the fireside, 
supported in an arm-chair by pillows, with every mark of <!-- 
page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>rapid decline and approaching death.&nbsp; A sweet smile
of friendly complacency enlightened her pale countenance, as she 
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very kind indeed, sir, to come so soon after I 
sent to you.&nbsp; You find me daily wasting away, and I cannot 
have long to continue here.&nbsp; My flesh and my heart fail; but
God is the strength of my weak heart, and I trust will be my 
portion for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was occasionally interrupted by her cough and
want of breath.&nbsp; Her tone of voice was clear, though feeble;
her manner solemn and collected; and her eye, though more dim 
than formerly, by no means wanting in liveliness as she 
spoke.&nbsp; I had frequently admired the superior language in 
which she expressed her ideas, as well as the scriptural 
consistency with which she communicated her thoughts.&nbsp; She 
had a good natural understanding, and grace, as is generally the 
case, had much improved it.&nbsp; On the present occasion I could
not help thinking she was peculiarly favoured.&nbsp; The whole 
strength of gracious and natural attainments seemed to be in full
exercise.</p>
<p>After taking my seat between the daughter and the mother (the 
latter fixing her fond eyes upon her child with great anxiety 
while we were conversing), I said to Elizabeth&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you enjoy a sense of the divine presence, and 
can rest all upon Him who has &lsquo;been with thee,&rsquo; and 
has &lsquo;kept thee in all places where thou hast gone,&rsquo; 
and will bring thee into &lsquo;the land of pure delight, where 
saints immortal reign.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I think I can.&nbsp; My mind has lately been 
sometimes clouded, but I believe it has been partly owing to the 
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>great weakness and suffering of my bodily frame, and 
partly to the envy of my spiritual enemy, who wants to persuade 
me that Christ has no love for me, and that I have been a 
self-deceiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you give way to his suggestions?&nbsp; Can you 
doubt, amidst such numerous tokens of past and present 
mercy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I mostly am enabled to preserve a clear 
evidence of his love.&nbsp; I do not wish to add to my other sins
that of denying his manifest goodness to my soul&mdash;I would 
acknowledge it to his praise and glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your present view of the state in which you 
were before you felt seriously concerned about the salvation of 
your soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I was a proud, thoughtless girl; fond of dress and
finery.&nbsp; I loved the world, and the things that are in the 
world.&nbsp; I lived in service among worldly people, and never 
had the happiness of being in a family where worship was 
regarded, and the souls of the servants cared for, either by 
master or mistress.&nbsp; I went once on a Sunday to church, more
to see and be seen than to pray or hear the word of God.&nbsp; I 
thought I was quite good enough to be saved, and disliked, and 
often laughed at, religious people.&nbsp; I was in great 
darkness; I knew nothing of the way of salvation.&nbsp; I never 
prayed, nor was sensible of the awful danger of a prayerless 
state.&nbsp; I wished to maintain the character of a good 
servant, and was much lifted up whenever I met with 
applause.&nbsp; I was tolerably moral and decent in my conduct, 
from motives of carnal and worldly policy; but I was a stranger 
to God and Christ.&nbsp; I neglected my soul; and had I died in 
such a state, hell must, and would justly, have been my 
portion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
65</span>&ldquo;How long is it since you heard the sermon which, 
you hope, through God&rsquo;s blessing, effected your 
conversion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it brought about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was reported that a Mr. ---, who was detained by 
contrary winds from embarking on board ship as chaplain to a 
distant part of the world, was to preach at church.&nbsp; Many 
advised me not to go, for fear he should turn my head, as they 
said he held strange notions.&nbsp; But curiosity, and an 
opportunity of appearing in a new gown, which I was very proud 
of, induced me to ask leave of my mistress to go.&nbsp; Indeed, 
sir, I had no better motives than vanity and curiosity.&nbsp; Yet
thus it pleased the Lord to order it for his own glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accordingly went to church, and saw a great crowd of 
people collected together.&nbsp; I often think of the contrary 
states of my mind during the former and latter part of the 
service.&nbsp; For a while, regardless of the worship of God, I 
looked around me, and was anxious to attract notice myself.&nbsp;
My dress, like that of too many gay, vain, and silly servant 
girls, was much above my station, and very different from that 
which becomes an humble sinner, who has a modest sense of 
propriety and decency.&nbsp; The state of my mind was visible 
enough from the foolish finery of my apparel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length the clergyman gave out his text: &lsquo;Be ye
clothed with humility.&rsquo;&nbsp; He drew a comparison between 
the clothing of the body with that of the soul.&nbsp; At a very 
early part of his discourse I began to feel ashamed of my passion
for fine dressing and apparel; but when he came to describe the 
garment of salvation with which a Christian is clothed, I felt a 
powerful discovery of the nakedness of my <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>own 
soul.&nbsp; I saw that I had neither the humility mentioned in 
the text, nor any one part of the true Christian character.&nbsp;
I looked at my gay dress, and blushed for shame on account of my 
pride.&nbsp; I looked at the minister, and he seemed to me as a 
messenger sent from heaven to open my eyes.&nbsp; I looked at the
congregation, and wondered whether any one else felt as I 
did.&nbsp; I looked at my heart, and it appeared full of 
iniquity.&nbsp; I trembled as he spoke, and yet I felt a great 
drawing of heart to the words he uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He opened the riches of divine grace in God&rsquo;s 
method of saving the sinner.&nbsp; I was astonished at what I had
been doing all the days of my life.&nbsp; He described the meek, 
lowly, and humble example of Christ; I felt proud, lofty, vain, 
and self-consequential.&nbsp; He represented Christ as 
&lsquo;Wisdom;&rsquo; I felt my ignorance.&nbsp; He held him 
forth as &lsquo;Righteousness;&rsquo; I was convinced of my own 
guilt.&nbsp; He proved him to be &lsquo;Sanctification;&rsquo; I 
saw my corruption.&nbsp; He proclaimed him as 
&lsquo;Redemption;&rsquo; I felt my slavery to sin and my 
captivity to Satan.&nbsp; He concluded with an animated address 
to sinners, in which he exhorted them to flee from the wrath to 
come, to cast off the love of outward ornament, to put on Jesus 
Christ, and be clothed with true humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that hour I never lost sight of the value of my 
soul and the danger of a sinful state.&nbsp; I inwardly blessed 
God for the sermon, although my mind was in a state of great 
confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preacher had brought forward the ruling passion of 
my heart, which was pride in outward dress; and by the grace of 
God it was made instrumental to the awakening of my soul.&nbsp; 
Happy, sir, would it be if many a poor girl, like <!-- page 
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>myself, were turned from the love of outward adorning 
and putting on of fine apparel, to seek that which is not 
corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which 
is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest part of the congregation, unused to such 
faithful and scriptural sermons, disliked and complained of the 
severity of the preacher; while a few, as I afterwards found, 
like myself, were deeply affected, and earnestly wished to hear 
him again.&nbsp; But he preached there no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that time I was led, through a course of private 
prayer, reading, and meditation, to see my lost state as a 
sinner, and the great mercy of God through Jesus Christ, in 
raising sinful dust and ashes to a share in the glorious 
happiness of heaven.&nbsp; And, O sir! what a Saviour I have 
found!&nbsp; He is more than I could ask or desire.&nbsp; In his 
fulness I have found all that my poverty could need; in his bosom
I have found a resting-place from all sin and sorrow; in his word
I have found strength against doubt and unbelief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you not soon convinced,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
your salvation must be an act of entire grace on the part of God,
wholly independent of your own previous works or 
deservings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir, what were my works, before I heard that 
sermon, but evil, carnal, selfish, and ungodly!&nbsp; The 
thoughts of my heart, from my youth upward, were only evil, and 
that continually.&nbsp; And my deservings, what were they, but 
the deservings of a fallen, depraved, careless soul, that 
regarded neither law nor gospel!&nbsp; Yes, sir, I immediately 
saw that if ever I were saved, it must be by the free mercy <!-- 
page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
68</span>of God, and that the whole praise and honour of the work
would be his from first to last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What change did you perceive in yourself with respect 
to the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appeared all vanity and vexation of spirit.&nbsp; I 
found it necessary to my peace of mind to come out from among 
them, and be separate.&nbsp; I gave myself to prayer; and many a 
happy hour of secret delight I enjoyed in communion with 
God.&nbsp; Often I mourned over my sins, and sometimes had a 
great conflict, through unbelief, fear, temptation to return back
again to my old ways, and a variety of difficulties which lay in 
my way.&nbsp; But He who loved me with an everlasting love drew 
me by his loving-kindness, showed me the way of peace, gradually 
strengthened me in my resolutions of leading a new life, and 
taught me, that while without him I could do nothing, I yet might
do all things through his strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not find many difficulties in your situation, 
owing to your change of principle and practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, every day of my life.&nbsp; I was laughed at 
by some, scolded at by others, scorned by enemies, and pitied by 
friends.&nbsp; I was called hypocrite, saint, false deceiver, and
many more names, which were meant to render me hateful in the 
sight of the world.&nbsp; But I esteemed the reproach of the 
cross an honour.&nbsp; I forgave and prayed for my persecutors, 
and remembered how very lately I had acted the same part towards 
others myself.&nbsp; I thought also that Christ endured the 
contradiction of sinners; and, as the disciple is not above his 
Master, I was glad to be in any way conformed to his 
sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not then feel for your family at 
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
69</span>&ldquo;Yes, that I did indeed, sir; they were never out 
of my thoughts.&nbsp; I prayed continually for them, and had a 
longing desire to do them good.&nbsp; In particular, I felt for 
my father and mother, as they were getting into years, and were 
very ignorant and dark in matters of religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; interrupted her mother, sobbing, 
&ldquo;ignorant and dark, sinful and miserable we were, till this
dear Betsy&mdash;this dear Betsy&mdash;this dear child, 
sir&mdash;brought Christ Jesus home to her poor father and 
mother&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dearest mother, say rather, Christ Jesus brought 
your poor daughter home to tell you what he had done for her 
soul, and I hope, to do the same for yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the Dairyman came in with two pails of milk 
hanging from the yoke on his shoulders.&nbsp; He had stood behind
the half-opened door for a few minutes, and heard the last 
sentences spoken by his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessing and mercy upon her!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it 
is very true; she left a good place of service on purpose to live
with us, that she might help us both in soul and body.&nbsp; Sir,
don&rsquo;t she look very ill?&nbsp; I think, sir, we 
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have her here long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to the Lord,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;All our times are in his hand, and happy it is that they 
are.&nbsp; I am willing to go; are you not willing, my father, to
part with me into <i>his</i> hands, who gave me to you at 
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me any question in the world but that,&rdquo; said 
the weeping father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you wish me to be 
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; answered he; &ldquo;let the Lord do 
with you and us as best pleases him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
70</span>I then asked her on what her present consolations 
chiefly depended, in the prospect of approaching death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely, sir, on my view of Christ.&nbsp; When I look 
at myself, many sins, infirmities, and imperfections cloud the 
image of Christ which I want to see in my own heart.&nbsp; But 
when I look at the Saviour himself, he is altogether lovely; 
there is not one spot in his countenance, nor one cloud over all 
his perfections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think of his coming in the flesh, and it reconciles 
me to the sufferings of the body; for he had them as well as 
I.&nbsp; I think of his temptations, and believe that he is able 
to succour me when I am tempted.&nbsp; Then I think of his cross,
and learn to bear my own.&nbsp; I reflect on his death, and long 
to die unto sin, so that it may no longer have dominion over 
me.&nbsp; I sometimes think on his resurrection, and trust that 
he has given me a part in it, for I feel that my affections are 
set upon things above.&nbsp; Chiefly I take comfort in thinking 
of him as at the right hand of the Father, pleading my cause, and
rendering acceptable even my feeble prayers, both for myself, 
and, as I hope, for my dear friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the views which, through mercy, I have of my 
Saviour&rsquo;s goodness; and they have made me wish and strive 
in my poor way to serve him, to give myself up to him, and to 
labour to do my duty in that state of life into which it has 
pleased God to call me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand times I should have fallen and fainted, if 
he had not upheld me.&nbsp; I feel that I am nothing without 
him.&nbsp; He is all in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so far as I can cast my care upon him, I find 
strength to do his will.&nbsp; May he give me grace to trust him 
till the last moment!&nbsp; I do not fear death, because I 
believe <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>that he has taken away its 
sting.&nbsp; And oh! what happiness beyond!&nbsp; Tell me, sir, 
whether you think I am right.&nbsp; I hope I am under no 
delusion.&nbsp; I dare not look for my hope in anything short of 
the entire fulness of Christ.&nbsp; When I ask my own heart a 
question, I am afraid to trust it, for it is treacherous, and has
often deceived me; but when I ask Christ, he answers me with 
promises that strengthen and refresh me, and leave me no room to 
doubt his power and will to save.&nbsp; I am in his hands, and 
would remain there; and I do believe that he will never leave nor
forsake me, but will perfect the thing that concerns me.&nbsp; He
loved me and gave himself for me, and I believe that his gifts 
and callings are without repentance.&nbsp; In this hope I live, 
in this hope I wish to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked around me, as she was speaking, and thought, 
&ldquo;Surely this is none other than the house of God, and the 
gate of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everything appeared neat, cleanly, 
and interesting.&nbsp; The afternoon had been rather overcast 
with dark clouds; but just now the setting sun shone brightly and
somewhat suddenly into the room.&nbsp; It was reflected from 
three or four rows of bright pewter plates and white earthenware,
arranged on shelves against the wall: it also gave brilliancy to 
a few prints of sacred subjects that hung there also, and served 
for monitors of the birth, baptism, crucifixion, and resurrection
of Christ.</p>
<p>A large map of Jerusalem, and a hieroglyphic of &ldquo;the old
and new man,&rdquo; completed the decorations on that side of the
room.&nbsp; Clean as was the white-washed wall, it was not 
cleaner than the rest of the place and its furniture.&nbsp; 
Seldom had the sun enlightened a house where order and general 
neatness (those sure attendants of pious poverty) were more 
conspicuous.</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
72</span>This gleam of setting sunshine was emblematical of the 
bright and serene close of this young Christian&rsquo;s departing
season.&nbsp; One ray happened to be reflected from a little 
looking-glass upon her face.&nbsp; Amidst her pallid and decaying
features there appeared a calm resignation, triumphant 
confidence, unaffected humility, and tender anxiety, which fully 
declared the feelings of her heart.</p>
<p>Some further affectionate conversation and a short prayer 
closed this interview.</p>
<p>As I rode home by departing daylight, a solemn tranquillity 
reigned throughout the scene.&nbsp; The gentle lowing of cattle, 
the bleating of sheep just penned in their folds, the humming of 
the insects of the night, the distant murmurs of the sea, the 
last notes of the birds of day, and the first warblings of the 
nightingale, broke upon the ear, and served rather to increase 
than lessen the peaceful serenity of the evening, and its 
corresponding effects on my own mind.&nbsp; It invited and 
cherished just such meditations as my visit had already 
inspired.&nbsp; Natural scenery, when viewed in a Christian 
mirror, frequently affords very beautiful illustrations of divine
truths.&nbsp; We are highly favoured when we can enjoy them, and 
at the same time draw near to God in them.</p>
<h3>PART VII.</h3>
<p>It is a pleasing consideration, that amidst the spiritual 
darkness which unhappily prevails in many parts of the land, God 
nevertheless has a people.&nbsp; It not unfrequently <!-- page 
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
73</span>happens that single individuals are to be found, who, 
though very disadvantageously situated with regard to the 
ordinary means of grace, have received truly saving impressions, 
and, through a blessing on secret meditation, reading, and 
prayer, are led to the closest communion with God, and become 
eminently devoted Christians.&nbsp; It is the no small error of 
too many professors of the present day, to overlook or undervalue
the instances of this kind which exist.&nbsp; The religious 
profession and opinions of some have too much of mere 
<i>machinery</i> in their composition.&nbsp; If every wheel, 
pivot, chain, spring, cog, or pinion, be not exactly in its 
place, or move not precisely according to a favourite and 
prescribed system, the whole is rejected as unworthy of 
regard.&nbsp; But happily &ldquo;the Lord knoweth them that are 
his;&rdquo; nor is the impression of his own seal wanting to 
characterize some who, in comparative seclusion from the 
religious world, &ldquo;name the name of Christ and depart from 
iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some real Christians so peculiarly circumstanced in 
this respect as to illustrate the poet&rsquo;s 
comparison,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;<br />
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And waste its sweetness on the desert 
air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet this was not altogether the case with the Dairyman&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; Her religion had indeed ripened in seclusion from
the world, and she was intimately known but to few; but she lived
usefully, departed most happily, and left a shining track behind 
her.&nbsp; While I attempt a faint delineation of it, may I catch
its influence, and become, <!-- page 74--><a 
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>through 
inexpressible mercy, a follower of &ldquo;them who through faith 
and patience inherit the promises!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the time wherein I visited her, as described in my last 
paper, I considered her end as fast approaching.&nbsp; One day I 
received a hasty summons to inform me that she was dying.&nbsp; 
It was brought by a soldier, whose countenance bespoke 
seriousness, good sense, and piety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sent, sir, by the father and mother of Elizabeth 
W---, at her own particular request, to say how much they all 
wish to see you.&nbsp; She is going <i>home</i>, sir, very fast 
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you known her long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month, sir.&nbsp; I love to visit the sick, and
hearing of her case from a person who lives close by our camp, I 
went to see her.&nbsp; I bless God that ever I did go.&nbsp; Her 
conversation has been very profitable to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rejoice,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to see in you, as I 
trust, a <i>brother soldier</i>.&nbsp; Though we differ in our 
outward regimentals, I hope we serve under the same spiritual 
Captain.&nbsp; I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My horse was soon ready.&nbsp; My military companion walked by
my side, and gratified me with very sensible and pious 
conversation.&nbsp; He related some remarkable testimonies of the
excellent disposition of the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, as they 
appeared from recent intercourse which he had had with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a bright diamond, sir,&rdquo; said the soldier, 
&ldquo;and will soon shine brighter than any diamond upon 
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed through lanes and fields, over hills and valleys, by
open and retired paths, sometimes crossing over and sometimes 
following the windings of a little brook which <!-- page 75--><a 
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>gently 
murmured by the road side.&nbsp; Conversation beguiled the 
distance, and shortened the apparent time of our journey, till we
were nearly arrived at the Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>As we approached it, we became silent.&nbsp; Thoughts of 
death, eternity, and salvation, inspired by the sight of a house 
where a dying believer lay, filled my own mind, and, I doubt not,
that of my companion also.</p>
<p>No living object yet appeared, except the Dairyman&rsquo;s 
dog, keeping a kind of mute watch at the door; for he did not, as
formerly, bark at my approach.&nbsp; He seemed to partake so far 
of the feelings appropriate to the circumstances of the family, 
as not to wish to give a hasty or painful alarm.&nbsp; He came 
forward to the little wicket-gate, then looked back at the house 
door, as if conscious there was sorrow within.&nbsp; It was as if
he wanted to say, &ldquo;Tread softly over the threshold, as you 
enter the house of mourning; for my master&rsquo;s heart is full 
of grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier took my horse and tied it up in a shed.&nbsp; A 
solemn serenity appeared to surround the whole place; it was only
interrupted by the breezes passing through the large elm-trees 
which stood near the house, and which my imagination indulged 
itself in thinking were plaintive sighs of sorrow.&nbsp; I gently
opened the door.&nbsp; No one appeared, and all was still 
silent.&nbsp; The soldier followed.&nbsp; We came to the foot of 
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are come!&rdquo; said a voice, which I knew to be 
the father&rsquo;s; &ldquo;they are come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared at the top.&nbsp; I gave him my hand, and said 
nothing.&nbsp; On entering the room above, I saw the aged mother 
and her son supporting the much-loved daughter and sister: the 
son&rsquo;s wife sat weeping in a window-seat, with <!-- page 
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>a 
child on her lap: two or three persons attended in the room to 
discharge any office which friendship or necessity might 
require.</p>
<p>I sat down by the bedside.&nbsp; The mother could not weep, 
but now and then sighed deeply, as she alternately looked at 
Elizabeth and at me.&nbsp; The big tear rolled down the 
brother&rsquo;s cheek, and testified an affectionate 
regard.&nbsp; The good old man stood at the foot of the bed, 
leaning upon the post, and unable to take his eyes off the child 
from whom he was so soon to part.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes were closed, and as yet she perceived 
me not.&nbsp; But over her face, though pale, sunk, and hollow, 
the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, had cast a 
triumphant calm.</p>
<p>The soldier, after a short pause, silently reached out his 
Bible towards me, pointing with his finger at 1 Cor. xv. 55, 56, 
57.&nbsp; I then broke silence by reading the passage, &ldquo;O 
death, where is thy sting?&nbsp; O grave, where is thy 
victory?&nbsp; The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin
is the law.&nbsp; But thanks be to God, which giveth us the 
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of these words her eyes opened, and something 
like a ray of divine light beamed on her countenance as she said,
&ldquo;Victory! victory! through our Lord Jesus 
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed again, taking no further notice of any one 
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be praised for the triumph of faith!&rdquo; said 
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; replied the soldier.</p>
<p>The Dairyman&rsquo;s uplifted eye showed that the Amen was in 
his heart, though his tongue failed to utter it.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
77</span>A short struggling for breath took place in the dying 
young woman, which was soon over; and then I said to 
her,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, do you not feel that you are 
supported?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord deals very gently with me,&rdquo; she 
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are not his promises now very precious to 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all yea and amen in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in much bodily pain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So little that I almost forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good the Lord is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how unworthy am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to see him as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;I believe that I 
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She again fell into a short slumber.</p>
<p>Looking at her mother, I said, &ldquo;What a mercy to have a 
child so near heaven as yours is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a mercy,&rdquo; she replied, in broken 
accents, &ldquo;if her poor old mother might but follow her 
there!&nbsp; But, sir, it is so hard to part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope through grace by faith you will soon meet to 
part no more; it will be but a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Dairyman, &ldquo;that thought 
supports me, and the Lord&rsquo;s goodness makes me feel more 
reconciled than I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;mother,&rdquo; said the reviving daughter,
&ldquo;He is good to me&mdash;trust Him, praise Him 
evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; added she, in a faint voice, &ldquo;I want 
to thank you for your kindness to me&mdash;I want to ask a 
favour;&mdash;you buried my sister&mdash;will you do the same for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All shall be as you wish, if God permit,&rdquo; I 
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, thank you&mdash;I have another favour 
to ask&mdash;When I am gone, remember my father and mother.&nbsp;
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
78</span>They are old, but I hope the good work is begun in their
souls&mdash;My prayers are heard&mdash;Pray come and see 
them&mdash;I cannot speak much, but I want to speak for their 
sakes&mdash;Sir, remember them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aged parents now sighed and sobbed aloud, uttering broken 
sentences, and gained some relief by such an expression of their 
feelings.</p>
<p>At length I said to Elizabeth, &ldquo;Do you experience any 
doubts or temptations on the subject of your eternal 
safety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; The Lord deals very gently with me, and 
gives me peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your views of the dark valley of death, now 
that you are passing through it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>not</i> dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord is <i>there</i>, and he is my light and my 
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any fears of more bodily suffering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord deals so gently with me, I can trust 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of a convulsion came on.&nbsp; When it was past she 
said again and again,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord deals very gently with me.&nbsp; Lord, I am 
thine; save me&mdash;Blessed Jesus&mdash;precious 
Saviour&mdash;His blood cleanseth from all sin&mdash;Who shall 
separate?&mdash;His name is Wonderful&mdash;Thanks be to 
God&mdash;He giveth the victory&mdash;I, even I, am saved&mdash;O
grace, mercy, and wonder!&mdash;Lord, receive my 
spirit!&mdash;Dear sir&mdash;dear father, mother, friends, I am 
going&mdash;but all is well, well, well&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relapsed again.&nbsp; We knelt down to prayer.&nbsp; The 
Lord was in the midst of us, and blessed us.</p>
<p>She did not again revive while I remained, nor ever speak any 
more words which could be understood.&nbsp; She slumbered <!-- 
page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>for about ten hours, and at last sweetly fell asleep in 
the arms of that Lord who had dealt so gently with her.</p>
<p>I left the house an hour after she had ceased to speak.&nbsp; 
I pressed her hand as I was taking leave, and said, &ldquo;Christ
is the resurrection and the life.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gently 
returned the pressure, but could neither open her eyes nor utter 
a reply.</p>
<p>I never had witnessed a scene so impressive as this 
before.&nbsp; It completely filled my imagination as I returned 
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;dear friend, till 
the morning of an eternal day shall renew our personal 
intercourse.&nbsp; Thou wast a brand plucked from the burning, 
that thou mightest become a star shining in the firmament of 
glory.&nbsp; I have seen thy light and thy good works, and will 
therefore glorify our Father which is in heaven.&nbsp; I have 
seen, in thy example, what it is to be a sinner freely saved by 
grace.&nbsp; I have learned from thee, as in a living mirror, 
<i>who</i> it is that begins, continues, and ends the work of 
faith and love.&nbsp; Jesus is all in all: he will and shall be 
glorified.&nbsp; He won the crown, and alone deserves to wear 
it.&nbsp; May no one attempt to rob him of his glory!&nbsp; He 
saves, and saves to the uttermost.&nbsp; Farewell dear sister in 
the Lord.&nbsp; Thy flesh and thy heart may fail; but God is the 
strength of thy heart, and shall be thy portion for 
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>PART VIII.</h3>
<p>Who can conceive or estimate the nature of that change which 
the soul of a believer must experience at the moment when, 
quitting its tabernacle of clay, it suddenly enters into <!-- 
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
80</span>the presence of God?&nbsp; If, even while &ldquo;we see 
through a glass darkly,&rdquo; the views of divine love and 
wisdom are so delightful to the eye of faith; what must be the 
glorious vision of God, when seen face to face!&nbsp; If it be so
valued a privilege here on earth to enjoy the communion of 
saints, and to take sweet counsel together with our 
fellow-travellers towards the heavenly kingdom; what shall we see
and know when we finally &ldquo;come unto mount Sion, and unto 
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an 
innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church
of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the 
Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to
Jesus the mediator of the new covenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If, during the sighs and tears of a mortal pilgrimage, the 
consolations of the Spirit are so precious and the hope full of 
immortality is so animating to the soul; what heart can conceive,
or what tongue utter its superior joys, when arrived at that 
state where sighing and sorrow flee away, and the tears shall be 
wiped from every eye?</p>
<p>Such ideas were powerfully associated together in my 
imagination, as I travelled onward to the house where, in solemn 
preparation for the grave, lay the remains of the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>She had breathed her last shortly after the visit related in 
my former account.&nbsp; Permission was obtained, as before in 
the case of her sister, that I should perform the funeral 
service.&nbsp; Many pleasing yet melancholy thoughts were 
connected with the fulfilment of this task.&nbsp; I retraced the 
numerous and important conversations which I had held with 
her.&nbsp; But these could now no longer be maintained on <!-- 
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
81</span>earth.&nbsp; I reflected on the interesting and 
improving nature of <i>Christian</i> friendships, whether formed 
in palaces or in cottages; and felt thankful that I had so long 
enjoyed that privilege with the subject of this memorial.&nbsp; I
then indulged a selfish sigh for a moment, on thinking that I 
could no longer hear the great truths of Christianity uttered by 
one who had drunk so deep of the waters of the river of 
life.&nbsp; But the rising murmur was checked by the animating 
thought, &ldquo;She is gone to eternal rest&mdash;could I wish 
her back again in this vale of tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the first sound of a tolling bell struck my 
ear.&nbsp; It proceeded from a village church in the valley 
directly beneath the ridge of a high hill, over which I had taken
my way.&nbsp; It was Elizabeth&rsquo;s funeral knell.</p>
<p>The sound was solemn; and, in ascending to the elevated spot 
over which I rode, it acquired a peculiar tone and 
character.&nbsp; Tolling at slow and regular intervals, (as was 
customary for a considerable time previous to the hour of 
burial,) the bell, as it were, proclaimed the blessedness of the 
dead who die in the Lord, and also the necessity of the living 
pondering these things, and laying them to heart.&nbsp; It seemed
to say, &ldquo;Hear my warning voice, thou son of man.&nbsp; 
There is but a step between thee and death.&nbsp; Arise, prepare 
thine house; for thou shalt die, and not live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scenery was in unison with that tranquil frame of mind 
which is most suitable for holy meditation.&nbsp; A rich and 
fruitful valley lay immediately beneath; it was adorned with corn
fields and pastures, through which a small river winded in a 
variety of directions, and many herds grazed upon its 
banks.&nbsp; A fine range of opposite hills, covered with grazing
flocks, terminated with a bold sweep into the ocean, <!-- page 
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>whose
blue waves appeared at a distance beyond.&nbsp; Several villages,
hamlets, and churches, were scattered in the valley.&nbsp; The 
noble mansions of the rich, and the lowly cottages of the poor, 
added their respective features to the landscape.&nbsp; The air 
was mild, and the declining sun occasioned a beautiful 
interchange of light and shade upon the sides of the hills.&nbsp;
In the midst of this scene, the chief sound that arrested 
attention was the bell tolling for the funeral of the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>Do any of my readers inquire why I describe so minutely the 
circumstances of prospect and scenery which may be connected with
the incidents I relate?&nbsp; My reply is, that the God of 
redemption is the God of creation likewise; and that we are 
taught in every part of the word of God to unite the admiration 
of the beauties and wonders of nature to every other motive for 
devotion.&nbsp; When David considered the heavens, the work of 
God&rsquo;s fingers, the moon and the stars which he has 
ordained, he was thereby led to the deepest humiliation of heart 
before his Maker.&nbsp; And when he viewed the sheep and the oxen
and the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air and the fish of
the sea, he was constrained to cry out, &ldquo;O Lord, our Lord, 
how excellent is thy name in all the earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am the poor man&rsquo;s friend, and wish more especially 
that every poor labouring man should know how to connect the 
goodness of God in creation and providence with the unsearchable 
riches of his grace in the salvation of a sinner.&nbsp; And where
can he learn this lesson more instructively than in looking 
around the fields where his labour is appointed, and there 
tracing the handiwork of God in all that he beholds?&nbsp; Such 
meditations have often afforded me both profit <!-- page 83--><a 
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and pleasure,
and I wish my readers to share them with me.</p>
<p>The Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage was rather more than a mile 
distant from the church.&nbsp; A lane, quite overshadowed with 
trees and high hedges, led from the foot of the hill to his 
dwelling.&nbsp; It was impossible at that time to overlook the 
suitable gloom of such an approach to the house of mourning.</p>
<p>I found, on my entrance, that several Christian friends, from 
different parts of the neighbourhood, had assembled together, to 
pay their last tribute of esteem and regard to the memory of the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Several of them had first become
acquainted with her during the latter stage of her illness; some 
few had maintained an affectionate intercourse with her for a 
longer period; but all seemed anxious to manifest their respect 
for one who was endeared to them by such striking testimonies of 
true Christianity.</p>
<p>I was requested to go into the chamber where the relatives and
a few other friends were gone to take a last look at the remains 
of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>It is not easy to describe the sensation which the mind 
experiences on the first sight of a dead countenance, which, when
living, was loved and esteemed for the sake of that soul which 
used to give it animation.&nbsp; A deep and awful view of the 
separation that has taken place between the soul and body of the 
deceased, since we last beheld them, occupies the feelings: our 
friend seems to be both near, and yet far off.&nbsp; The most 
interesting and valuable part is fled away; what remains is but 
the earthly, perishing habitation, no longer occupied by its 
tenant.&nbsp; Yet the features present the accustomed association
of friendly intercourse.&nbsp; For one moment, we could think 
them asleep.&nbsp; The next <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>reminds us 
that the blood circulates no more: the eye has lost its power of 
seeing, the ear of hearing, the heart of throbbing, and the limbs
of moving.&nbsp; Quickly a thought of glory breaks in upon the 
mind, and we imagine the dear departed soul to be arrived at its 
long-wished-for rest.&nbsp; It is surrounded by cherubim and 
seraphim, and sings the song of Moses and the Lamb on Mount 
Zion.&nbsp; Amid the solemn stillness of the chamber of death, 
imagination hears heavenly hymns chanted by the spirits of just 
men made perfect.&nbsp; In another moment, the livid lips and 
sunken eye of the clay-cold corpse recall our thoughts to earth 
and to ourselves again.&nbsp; And while we think of mortality, 
sin, death, and the grave, we feel the prayer rise in our bosom, 
&ldquo;Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end
be like his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there be a moment when Christ and salvation, death, 
judgment, heaven, and hell, appear more than ever to be momentous
subjects of meditation, it is that which brings us to the side of
a coffin containing the body of a departed believer.</p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s features were altered, but much of her 
likeness remained.&nbsp; Her father and mother sat at the head, 
her brother at the foot of the coffin.&nbsp; The father silently 
and alternately looked upon his dead child and then lifted up his
eyes to heaven.&nbsp; A struggle for resignation to the will of 
God was manifest in his countenance; while the tears, rolling 
down his aged cheeks, at the same time declared his grief and 
affection.&nbsp; The poor mother cried and sobbed aloud, and 
appeared to be much overcome by the shock of separation from a 
daughter so justly dear to her.&nbsp; The weakness and infirmity 
of old age added a character to her sorrow which called for much 
tenderness and compassion.</p>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
85</span>A remarkably decent-looking woman, who had the 
management of the few simple though solemn ceremonies which the 
case required, advanced towards me, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, this is rather a sight of joy than of 
sorrow.&nbsp; Our dear friend Elizabeth finds it to be so, I have
no doubt.&nbsp; She is beyond <i>all</i> sorrow: do you not think
she is, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what I have known, and seen, and heard,&rdquo; I 
replied, &ldquo;I feel the fullest assurance, that while her body
remains here, her soul is with her Saviour in paradise.&nbsp; She
loved him <i>here</i>, and <i>there</i> she enjoys the pleasures 
which are at his right hand for evermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, mercy upon a poor old creature, almost broken 
down with age and grief!&mdash;What shall I 
do!&mdash;Betsy&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; My daughter&rsquo;s 
dead&mdash;O my child!&nbsp; I shall never see thee more.&nbsp; 
God be merciful to me a sinner!&rdquo; sobbed out the poor 
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That last prayer, my dear good woman,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;will bring you and your child together again.&nbsp; It is 
a cry that has brought thousands to glory.&nbsp; It brought your 
daughter there, and I hope it will bring you thither 
likewise.&nbsp; God will in no wise cast out any that come to 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the Dairyman, breaking the long 
silence he had maintained, &ldquo;let us trust God with our 
child; and let us trust him with our own selves.&nbsp; The Lord 
gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the 
Lord!&nbsp; We are old, and can have but a little further to 
travel in our journey, and then&mdash;,&rdquo; he could say no 
more</p>
<p>The soldier, mentioned in my last paper, reached a Bible into 
my hand, and said, &ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you would not object to 
reading a chapter before we go to the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so; it was the fourteenth of the book of Job.&nbsp; A 
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
86</span>sweet tranquillity prevailed while I read it.&nbsp; Each
minute that was spent in this funeral chamber seemed to be 
valuable.&nbsp; I made a few observations on the chapter, and 
connected them with the case of our departed sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am but a poor soldier,&rdquo; said our military 
friend, &ldquo;and have nothing of this world&rsquo;s goods 
beyond my daily subsistence; but I would not exchange my hope of 
salvation in the next world for all that this world could bestow 
without it.&nbsp; What is wealth without grace?&nbsp; Blessed be 
God! as I march about from one quarter to another, I still find 
the Lord wherever I go; and, thanks be to his holy name, he is 
here to-day in the midst of this company of the living and the 
dead.&nbsp; I feel that it is good to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some other persons present began to take a part in our 
conversation, in the course of which the life and experience of 
the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter were brought forward in a very 
interesting manner.&nbsp; Each friend had something to relate in 
testimony of her gracious disposition.&nbsp; A young woman under 
twenty, who had hitherto been a very light and trifling 
character, appeared to be remarkably impressed by the 
conversation of that day; and I have since had ground to believe 
that Divine grace then began to influence her in the choice of 
that better part which shall not be taken from her.</p>
<p>What a contrast does such a scene as this exhibit, when 
compared with the dull, formal, unedifying, and often indecent 
manner, in which funeral parties assemble in the house of 
death!</p>
<p>As we conversed the parents revived.&nbsp; Our subject of 
discourse was delightful to their hearts.&nbsp; Their child 
seemed almost to be alive again, while we talked of her.&nbsp; 
Tearful smiles often brightened their countenances, as they heard
<!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
87</span>the voice of friendship uttering their daughter&rsquo;s 
praises; or rather the praises of him who made her a vessel of 
mercy and an instrument of spiritual good to her family.</p>
<p>The time for departing to the church was now at hand.</p>
<p>I went to take my last look at the deceased.</p>
<p>There was much written on her countenance.&nbsp; She had 
evidently died with a smile.&nbsp; It still remained, and spoke 
the tranquillity of her departed soul.&nbsp; According to the 
custom of the country she was decorated with leaves and flowers 
in the coffin: she seemed as a bride gone forth to meet the 
bridegroom.&nbsp; These, indeed, were fading flowers, but they 
reminded me of that paradise whose flowers are immortal, and 
where her never-dying soul is at rest.</p>
<p>I remembered the last words which I had heard her speak, and 
was instantly struck with the happy thought, that &ldquo;death 
was indeed swallowed up in victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I slowly retired, I said inwardly, &ldquo;Peace, my 
honoured sister, be to <i>thy</i> memory and to <i>my</i> soul, 
till we meet in a better world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a little time the procession formed: it was rendered the 
more interesting by the consideration of so many that followed 
the coffin being persons of a devout and spiritual 
character.&nbsp; The distance was rather more than a mile.&nbsp; 
I resolved to continue with and go before them, as they moved 
slowly onwards.&nbsp; Immediately after the body came the 
venerable father and mother, <a name="citation87"></a><a 
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a> bending with age, 
and weeping through much <!-- page 88--><a 
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>affliction of
heart.&nbsp; Their appearance was calculated to excite every 
emotion of pity, love, and esteem.&nbsp; The other relatives 
followed them in order, and the several attendant friends took 
their places behind.</p>
<p>After we had advanced about a hundred yards, my meditation was
unexpectedly and most agreeably interrupted by the friends who 
attended beginning to sing a funeral psalm.&nbsp; Nothing could 
be more sweet or solemn.&nbsp; The well-known effect of the open 
air in softening and blending the sounds of music, was here 
peculiarly felt.&nbsp; The road through which we passed was 
beautiful and romantic.&nbsp; It lay at the foot of a hill, which
occasionally re-echoed the voices of the singers, and seemed to 
give faint replies to the notes of the mourners.&nbsp; The 
funeral knell was distinctly heard from the church tower, and 
greatly increased the effect which this simple and becoming 
service produced.</p>
<p>We went by several cottages: a respectful attention was 
universally observed as we passed; and the countenances of many 
proclaimed their regard for the departed young woman.&nbsp; The 
singing was regularly continued, with occasional intervals of 
about five minutes during our whole progress.</p>
<p>I cannot describe the state of my own mind as peculiarly 
connected with this solemn singing.&nbsp; I was reminded of older
times and ancient piety.&nbsp; I wished the practice more 
frequent.&nbsp; It seems well calculated to excite and cherish 
devotion and religious affections.</p>
<p>Music, when judiciously brought into the service of religion, 
is one of the most delightful, and not least efficacious means of
grace.&nbsp; I pretend not too minutely to conjecture as to the 
actual nature of those pleasures which, after the resurrection, 
the re-united body and soul will enjoy in <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>heaven; but I
can hardly persuade myself that melody and harmony will be 
wanting, when even the sense of hearing shall itself be 
glorified.</p>
<p>We at length arrived at the church.&nbsp; Looking upwards as I
drew near the church, I observed a dial on the wall.&nbsp; The 
sun&rsquo;s declining rays directed the shadow to the evening 
hour.&nbsp; As I passed underneath this simple but solemn 
monitor, I was reminded of the lapse of time, the uncertainty of 
life, and sure approach of eternity.&nbsp; I thought with David, 
&ldquo;We are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all 
our fathers; our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is none
abiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, so teach us to number our days, that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The service was heard with deep and affectionate 
attention.&nbsp; When we came to the grave, the hymn which 
Elizabeth had selected was sung.&nbsp; All was devout, simple, 
animating.&nbsp; We committed our dear sister&rsquo;s body to the
earth, in full hope of a joyful resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>Thus was the veil of separation drawn for a season.&nbsp; She 
is departed, and no more seen.&nbsp; But she will be seen on the 
right hand of her Redeemer at the last day, and will again appear
to his glory, a miracle of grace and monument of mercy.</p>
<p>My reader, rich or poor, shall you and I appear there 
likewise?&nbsp; Are we &ldquo;clothed with humility,&rdquo; and 
arrayed in the wedding garment of a redeemer&rsquo;s 
righteousness?&nbsp; Are we turned from idols to serve the living
God?&nbsp; Are we sensible of our own emptiness, and therefore 
flying to a Saviour&rsquo;s fulness to obtain grace and 
strength?&nbsp; Do we indeed live in Christ, and on him, and by 
him, and with him?&nbsp; Is he our all in all?&nbsp; Are we 
&ldquo;lost, and found?&rdquo; &ldquo;dead, and alive 
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>My <i>poor</i> reader, the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter was
a <i>poor</i> girl, and the child of a <i>poor</i> man.&nbsp; 
Herein thou resemblest her: but dost thou resemble <i>her</i> as 
she resembled Christ?&nbsp; Art thou made rich by faith?&nbsp; 
Hast thou a crown laid up for thee?&nbsp; Is thine heart set upon
heavenly riches?&nbsp; If not, read this story once more, and 
then pray earnestly for like precious faith.</p>
<p>But if, through grace, thou dost love and serve the Redeemer 
that saved the Dairyman&rsquo;s daughter, grace, peace, and mercy
be with thee!&nbsp; The lines are fallen unto thee in pleasant 
places: thou hast a goodly heritage.&nbsp; Press forward in duty,
and wait upon the Lord, possessing thy soul in holy 
patience.&nbsp; Thou hast just been with me to the grave of a 
departed believer.&nbsp; Now &ldquo;go thy way till the end be; 
for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the 
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth died May 30, 1801, aged 31 years.</p>

91</span>THE NEGRO SERVANT.</h2>
<h3>PART I.</h3>
<p>If a map of the world, instead of being coloured, as is usual,
with many gay and brilliant tints, in order to distinguish its 
various continents, kingdoms, and islands from each other, were 
to be painted with darker or brighter hues corresponding with the
spiritual character of the inhabitants, what a gloomy aspect 
would be presented, to the eye of the <i>Christian</i> 
geographer, by the greater portion of the habitable globe!&nbsp; 
How dark would be the shade thus cast over the larger districts 
of the vast continents of Asia and America! and what a mass of 
gloom would characterize the African quarter of the world!</p>
<p>Here and there a bright spot would mark the residence of a few
missionary labourers, devoting themselves to God, and scattering 
the rays of Christian light among the surrounding heathen; but 
over the greater part &ldquo;the blackness of darkness&rdquo; 
would emblematically describe the iron reign of Mohammedan 
superstition and Pagan idolatry.</p>
<p>The Christian prays that God would have &ldquo;respect unto 
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full 
of the habitations of cruelty.&rdquo;&nbsp; He hopes to see the 
nations &ldquo;open their eyes, and turn from darkness to light, 
and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive 
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are 
sanctified by faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curse originally pronounced on the descendants of Ham has,
in a variety of respects, both temporal and spiritual, been 
awfully fulfilled&mdash;&ldquo;A servant of servants shall he 
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Slavery, as well of mind as body, has been 
continued amongst the Africans through their generations in a 
manner which at once proves the truth of the Divine prediction, 
and yet calls aloud for the ardent prayers and active exertions 
of Christians in their behalf.&nbsp; The time will come when the 
heathen shall be proved to have been given to Christ &ldquo;for 
an inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his 
possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; The degraded Hottentot, and the poor 
benighted Negro, will look from the ends of the earth unto Jesus,
and be saved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many shall run to and fro, and 
knowledge shall be increased.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Redeemer 
&ldquo;shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be 
satisfied,&rdquo; in beholding the gathering together, not only 
of the outcasts of Israel that are ready to perish, but of 
churches and people from all the tongues, and kindreds, and 
nations of the earth.&nbsp; In the day of his appearing, the sons
of Africa will vie with their brethren of the north, and the 
west, and the east, in resounding the praises of God their 
Saviour from one end of the earth to the other.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we rejoice in every occasional instance of 
the love and power of God in effecting the conversion of some, 
who appear as the first-fruits of that harvest which <!-- page 
93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>shall
hereafter so fruitfully grow up, to the honour of Christ and the 
blessedness of his redeemed people.</p>
<p>The following narrative of real facts may, perhaps, illustrate
the importance of the foregoing remarks.</p>
<p>During a residence of some years&rsquo; continuance in the 
neighbourhood of the sea, an officer of the navy called upon me, 
and stated that he had just taken a lodging in the parish for his
wife and children; and had a Negro, who had been three years in 
his service.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lad is a deserving fellow,&rdquo; 
said the officer, &ldquo;and he has a great desire to be 
baptized.&nbsp; I have promised him to ask you to do it, if you 
have not any objections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know anything,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;of the 
principles of the Christian religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am sure he does,&rdquo; answered the 
captain; &ldquo;for he talks a great deal about it in the 
kitchen, and often gets laughed at for his pains; but he takes it
all very patiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he behave well as your servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that he does; he is as honest and civil a fellow 
as ever came on board ship, or lived in a house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he always so well behaved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the officer; &ldquo;when I first had 
him he was often very unruly and deceitful; but for the last two 
years he has been quite like another creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I shall be very glad to see him, and think 
it probable I shall wish to go through a course of instruction 
and examination; during which I shall be able to form a judgment 
how far it will be right to admit him to the sacrament of 
baptism.&nbsp; Can he read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied his master; &ldquo;he has been 
taking great <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>pains to learn to read for some time 
past, and can make out a chapter in the Bible pretty well, as my 
maid-servant informs me.&nbsp; He speaks English better than many
of his countrymen, but you will find it a little broken.&nbsp; 
When will it be convenient that I should send him over to 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow afternoon, sir, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall come to you about four o&rsquo;clock, and you 
shall see what you can make of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this promise he took his leave.&nbsp; I felt glad of an 
opportunity of instructing a native of that land whose wrongs and
injuries had often caused me to sigh and mourn; the more so, when
I reflected <i>who</i> had been the aggressors.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour my Negro disciple arrived.&nbsp; He was 
a very young-looking man, with a sensible, lively, and pleasing 
countenance.</p>
<p>I desired him to sit down, and said, &ldquo;Your master 
informs me that you wish to have some conversation with me 
respecting Christian baptism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; me very much wish to be a Christian,&rdquo; 
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because me know that Christian go to heaven when he 
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you had that wish?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since me heard one goot minister preach in 
America, two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Africa.&nbsp; Me was very little boy when me was 
made slave by the white men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
95</span>&ldquo;Me left father and mother one day at home to go 
get shells by de sea-shore, and as me was stooping down to gather
them up, some white sailors came out of a boat and took me 
away.&nbsp; Me never see father nor mother again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me was put into ship, and brought to Jamaica and sold 
to a master, who kept me in his house to serve him some years; 
when, about three years ago, Captain W---, my master, dat spoke 
to you, bought me to be his servant on board his ship.&nbsp; And 
he be goot master; he gave me my liberty, and made me free, and 
me live with him ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what thoughts had you about your soul all that time
before you went to America?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no care for my soul at all before den.&nbsp; No man 
teach me one word about my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now tell me further about what happened to you in
America.&nbsp; How came you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master take me dere in his ship, and he stop dere 
one month, and den me hear de goot minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did the minister say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said me was a great sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! did he speak to you in particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, me tink so; for dere was great many to hear him, 
but he tell dem all about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say about all de tings dat were in my 
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sin, my ignorance, my know noting, my believe 
noting.&nbsp; De goot minister make me see dat me <i>tink</i> 
noting goot, me <i>do</i> noting goot.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>&ldquo;And what else did he tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sometime look me in de face, and say dat Jesus 
Christ came to die for sinners, poor black sinners as well as 
white sinners.&nbsp; Me tought dis was very goot, very goot, 
indeed, to do so for a wicked sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what made you think this was all spoken to you in 
particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because me sure no such wicked sinner as me in all de 
place.&nbsp; De goot minister must know me was dere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you think of yourself while he preached 
about Jesus Christ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, me was very much afraid, when he said the wicked 
must be turned into hell-fire.&nbsp; For me felt dat me was very 
wicked sinner, and dat make me cry.&nbsp; And he talk much about 
de love of Christ to sinners, and dat make me cry more.&nbsp; And
me tought me must love Jesus Christ; but me not know how, and dat
make me cry again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear more sermons than one during that 
month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; master gave me leave to go tree times, and 
all de times me wanted to love Jesus more, and do what Jesus 
said; but my heart seem sometime hard, like a stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever heard any preaching since that 
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, till me hear sermon at dis church last Sunday, 
and den me long to be baptized in Jesus&rsquo; name; for me had 
no Christian friends to baptize me when little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have been your thoughts all the time since you
first heard these sermons in America?&nbsp; Did you tell anybody 
what you then felt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, me speak to nobody but to God den.&nbsp; De goot 
minister say dat God hear de cry of de poor; so me cry to <!-- 
page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
97</span>God, and he hear me.&nbsp; And me often tink about Jesus
Christ, and wish to be like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught you to read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God teach me to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by saying so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God give me desire to read, and dat make reading 
easy.&nbsp; Master give me Bible, and one sailor show me de 
letters: and so me learned to read by myself, with God&rsquo;s 
good help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you read in the Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, me read all about Jesus Christ, and how he loved 
sinners; and wicked men killed him, and he died, and came again 
from de grave; and all dis for poor Negro.&nbsp; And it sometime 
make me cry, to tink that Christ love so poor Negro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do the people say about your reading, and 
praying, and attention to the things of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some wicked people, dat do not love Jesus Christ, call 
me great fool, and Negro dog, and black hypocrite.&nbsp; And dat 
make me sometimes feel angry; but den me remember Christian must 
not be angry, for Jesus Christ was called ugly black names, and 
he was quiet as a lamb; and so den me remember Jesus Christ; and 
me say nothing again to dem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much delighted with the simplicity and apparent 
sincerity of this poor Negro, and wished to ascertain what 
measure of light and feeling he possessed on a few leading 
points.&nbsp; St. Paul&rsquo;s summary of religion <a 
name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97" 
class="citation">[97]</a> occuring to me, <!-- page 98--><a 
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>I said, 
&ldquo;Tell me what is faith?&nbsp; What is your faith?&nbsp; 
What do you believe about Jesus Christ, and your own 
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;dat Jesus Christ 
came into de world to save sinners; and dough me be chief of 
sinners, yet Jesus will save me, dough me be only poor black 
Negro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your hope?&nbsp; What do you hope for, both as 
to this life and that which is to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me hope Jesus Christ will take good care of me, and 
keep me from sin and harm, while me live here; and me hope, when 
me come to die, to go and live with him always, and never die 
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your thoughts about Christian love or 
charity,&mdash;I mean, whom and what do you most love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me love God de Father, because he was so goot to send 
his Son.&nbsp; Me love Jesus Christ, because he love men.&nbsp; 
Me love all men, black men and white men too; for God made dem 
all.&nbsp; Me love goot Christian people, because Jesus love dem,
and dey love Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was my first conversation with this young disciple.&nbsp;
I rejoiced in the prospect of receiving him into the Church 
agreeably to his desire.&nbsp; I wished, however, to converse 
somewhat further, and inquire more minutely into his conduct; and
promised to ride over and see him in a few days at his 
master&rsquo;s lodgings.</p>
<p>When he was gone, I thought within myself, God has indeed 
redeemed souls by the blood of his Son, &ldquo;out of 
<i>every</i> kindred, and tongue, and people, and 
nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; If many of them for a season are devoted to 
earthly slavery, <a name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98" 
class="citation">[98]</a> through the cruel avarice of man, yet, 
blessed be God, some <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>amongst them are, through divine 
grace, called to the glorious liberty of the children of God; and
so are redeemed from the slavery of him who takes so many captive
at his will.&nbsp; It is a happy thought, that &ldquo;Ethiopia 
shall soon stretch forth her hands unto God.&nbsp; Sing unto God,
ye kingdoms of the earth.&nbsp; Oh, sing praises unto the 
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>PART II.</h3>
<p>When we endeavour to estimate the worth of an immortal soul, 
we are utterly lost in the attempt.&nbsp; The art of spiritual 
computation is not governed by the same principles and rules 
which guide our speculations concerning earthly objects.&nbsp; 
The value of gold, silver, merchandize, food, raiment, lands, and
houses, is easily regulated, by custom, convenience, or 
necessity.&nbsp; Even the more capricious and imaginary worth of 
a picture, medal, or statue, may be reduced to something of 
systematic rule.&nbsp; Crowns and sceptres have had their 
adjudged valuation; and kingdoms have been bought and sold for 
sums of money.&nbsp; But who can affix the adequate price to a 
human soul?&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall it profit a man, if he shall 
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man 
give in exchange for his soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principles of ordinary arithmetic all fail here; and we 
are constrained to say, that He alone who paid the ransom for 
sinners, and made the souls of men his &ldquo;purchased 
possession,&rdquo; can comprehend and solve the arduous 
question.&nbsp; They are, indeed, &ldquo;bought with a 
price,&rdquo; but are &ldquo;not redeemed with corruptible 
things, as silver and <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>gold; but with the precious blood of
Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without 
spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall only ascertain the value of a soul, 
when we shall be fully able to estimate the worth of a 
Saviour.</p>
<p>Too often have we been obliged to hear what is the price which
sordid, unfeeling avarice has affixed to the <i>body</i> of a 
poor Negro slave; let us now attempt, while we pursue the 
foregoing narrative, to meditate on the value which Infinite 
Mercy has attached to his <i>soul</i>.</p>
<p>Not many days after my first interview with my Negro disciple,
I went from home with the design of visiting and conversing with 
him again at his master&rsquo;s house, which was situated in a 
part of the parish nearly four miles distant from my own.&nbsp; 
The road which I took lay over a lofty down, which commands a 
prospect of scenery seldom exceeded in beauty and 
magnificence.&nbsp; It gave birth to silent but instructive 
contemplation.</p>
<p>The down itself was covered with sheep, grazing on its 
wholesome and plentiful pasture.&nbsp; Here and there a 
shepherd&rsquo;s boy kept his appointed station, and watched over
the flock committed to his care.&nbsp; I viewed it as an emblem 
of my own situation and employment.&nbsp; Adjoining the hill lay 
an extensive parish, wherein many souls were given me to watch 
over, and render an account of, at the day of the great 
Shepherd&rsquo;s appearing.&nbsp; The pastoral scene before me 
seemed to be a living parable, illustrative of my own spiritual 
charge.&nbsp; I felt a prayerful wish, that the good Shepherd, 
who gave His life for the sheep, might enable me to be faithful 
to my trust.</p>
<p>It occurred to me, about the same time, that my young African 
friend was a sheep of another more distant fold, <!-- page 
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
101</span>which Christ will yet bring to hear his voice.&nbsp; 
For there shall be one fold and one Shepherd, and all nations 
shall be brought to acknowledge that He alone &ldquo;restoreth 
our souls, and leadeth us in the paths of righteousness for his 
name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the left hand of the hill, as 
I advanced eastward, and immediately under its declivity, 
extended a beautiful tract of land intersected by a large arm of 
the sea, which (as the tide was fast flowing in) formed a broad 
lake or haven of three miles in length.&nbsp; Woods, villages, 
cottages, and churches, surrounded it in most pleasing variety of
prospect.&nbsp; Beyond this lay a large fleet of ships of war, 
and not far from it another of merchantmen, both safe at anchor, 
and covering a tract of the sea of several miles in extent.&nbsp;
Beyond this, again, I saw the fortifications, dockyards, and 
extensive public edifices of a large seaport town.&nbsp; The sun 
shone upon the windows of the buildings and the flags of the 
ships with great brightness, and added much to the splendour of 
the view.</p>
<p>I thought of the concerns of empires and plans of statesmen, 
the fate of nations and the horrors of war.&nbsp; Happy will be 
that day when He shall make wars to cease unto the end of the 
earth, and peace to be established in its borders.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let us be thankful for those vessels and 
instruments of defence, which, in the hands of God, preserve our 
country from the hand of the enemy and the fury of the 
destroyer.&nbsp; What, thought I, do we not owe to the exertions 
of the numerous crews on board those ships, who leave their homes
to fight their country&rsquo;s battles and maintain its cause, 
whilst we sit every man under his vine and fig-tree, tasting the 
sweets of a tranquillity unknown to most other nations in these 
days of conflict and bloodshed!</p>
<p><!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>On my right hand, to the south and south-east, the 
unbounded ocean displayed its mighty waves.&nbsp; It was covered 
with vessels of every size, sailing in all directions: some 
outward-bound to the most distant parts of the world; others, 
after a long voyage, returning home, laden with the produce of 
remote climes: some going forth in search of the enemy; others 
sailing back to port after the hard-fought engagement, and 
bearing the trophies of victory in the prizes which accompanied 
them home.</p>
<p>At the south-west of the spot on which I was riding extended a
beautiful semicircular bay, of about nine or ten miles in 
circumference, bounded by high cliffs of white, red, and 
brown-coloured earths.&nbsp; Beyond this lay a range of hills, 
whose tops are often buried in cloudy mists, but which then 
appeared clear and distinct.&nbsp; This chain of hills, meeting 
with another from the north, bounds a large fruitful vale, whose 
fields, now ripe for harvest, proclaimed the goodness of God in 
the rich provision which he makes for the sons of men.&nbsp; It 
is he who prepares the corn: he crowns the year with his 
goodness, and his paths drop fatness.&nbsp; &ldquo;They drop upon
the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills rejoice on 
every side.&nbsp; The pastures are clothed with flocks; the 
valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they
also sing.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The 
roving sight<br />
Pursues its pleasing course o&rsquo;er neighbouring hills,<br />
Of many a different form and different hue:<br />
Bright with the rip&rsquo;ning corn, or green with grass,<br />
Or dark with clovers purple bloom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I looked upon the numerous ships moving before me, I 
remembered the words of the psalmist: &ldquo;They that go down to
the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; <!-- page 
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the
deep.&nbsp; For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which
lifteth up the waves thereof.&nbsp; They mount up to the heaven, 
they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of
trouble.&nbsp; They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken 
man, and are at their wits end.&nbsp; Then they cry unto the Lord
in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their 
distresses.&nbsp; He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves 
thereof are still.&nbsp; Then are they glad because they be 
quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.&nbsp; Oh 
that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his 
wonderful works to the children of men!&rdquo; (Ps. cvii. 
23-31.)</p>
<p>The Negro servant then occurred to my mind.&nbsp; Perhaps, 
thought I, some of these ships are bound to Africa, in quest of 
that most infamous object of merchandise, a cargo of black 
slaves.&nbsp; Inhuman traffic for a nation that bears the name of
Christian!&nbsp; Perhaps these very waves, that are now dashing 
on the rocks at the foot of this hill, have, on the shores of 
Africa, borne witness to the horrors of forced separation between
wives and husbands, parents and children, torn asunder by 
merciless men, whose hearts have been hardened against the common
feeling of humanity by long custom in this cruel trade.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain 
mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; When shall the endeavours of <i>that</i> 
truly Christian <i>friend</i> of the oppressed Negro be crowned 
with success, in the abolition of this wicked and disgraceful 
traffic? <a name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103" 
class="citation">[103]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>As I pursued the meditations which this magnificent and
varied scenery excited in my mind, I approached the edge of a 
tremendous perpendicular cliff, with which the down 
terminates.&nbsp; I dismounted from my horse, and tied it to a 
bush.&nbsp; The breaking of the waves against the foot of the 
cliff at so great a distance beneath me, produced an incessant 
and pleasing murmur.&nbsp; The sea-gulls were flying between the 
top of the cliff where I stood and the rocks below, attending 
upon their nests, built in the holes of the cliff.&nbsp; The 
whole scene in every direction was grand and impressive; it was 
suitable to devotion.&nbsp; The Creator appeared in the works of 
his creation, and called upon the creatures to honour and 
adore.&nbsp; To the believer, this exercise is doubly 
delightful.&nbsp; He possesses a right to the enjoyment of nature
and providence, as well as to the privileges of grace.&nbsp; His 
title-deed runs thus: &ldquo;All things are yours; whether Paul, 
or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to come; all are yours; and ye are 
Christ&rsquo;s; and Christ is God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cast my eye downwards a little to the left towards a small 
cove, the shore of which consists of fine hard sand.&nbsp; It is 
surrounded by fragments of rock, chalk-cliffs, and steep banks of
broken earth.&nbsp; Shut out from human intercourse and 
dwellings, it seems formed for retirement and 
contemplation.&nbsp; On one of these rocks I unexpectedly 
observed a man sitting with a book which he was reading.&nbsp; 
The place was near two hundred yards perpendicularly below me, 
but I soon discovered by his dress, and by the black colour of 
his features contrasted with the white rocks beside him, that it 
was no other than my Negro disciple, with, as I doubted not, a 
Bible in his hand.&nbsp; I rejoiced at <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>this 
unlooked-for opportunity of meeting him in so solitary and 
interesting a situation.&nbsp; I descended a steep bank, winding 
by a kind of rude staircase, formed by fishermen and 
shepherds&rsquo; boys, in the side of the cliff down to the 
shore.</p>
<p>He was intent on his book, and did not perceive me till I 
approached very near to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William, is that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, massa! me very glad to see you.&nbsp; How came 
massa into dis place?&nbsp; Me tought nobody here, but only God 
and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to your master&rsquo;s house to see you, 
and rode round by this way for the sake of the prospect.&nbsp; I 
often come here in fine weather, to look at the sea and 
shipping.&nbsp; Is that your Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; <a name="citation105"></a><a 
href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a> dis my dear goot 
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to see you so well 
employed.&nbsp; It is a good sign, William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa, a sign that God is goot to me; but me never
goot to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me never tank him enough; me never pray to him enough: 
me never remember enough who give me all dese goot tings.&nbsp; 
Massa, me afraid my heart is very bat.&nbsp; Me wish me was like 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like me, William?&nbsp; Why, you are like me, a poor 
helpless sinner, that must, as well as yourself, perish in his 
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
106</span>sins, unless God, of his infinite mercy and grace, 
pluck him as a brand from the burning, and make him an instance 
of distinguishing love and favour.&nbsp; There is no difference; 
we have both come short of the glory of God: all have 
sinned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, me not like you, massa; me tink nobody like 
me,&mdash;nobody feel such a heart as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, William, your feelings, I am persuaded, are like 
those of every truly convinced soul, who sees the exceeding 
sinfulness of sin, and the greatness of the price which Christ 
Jesus paid for the sinner&rsquo;s ransom.&nbsp; You can say, in 
the words of the hymn,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I the chief of sinners am,<br />
But Jesus died for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, sir, me believe that Jesus died for poor 
Negro.&nbsp; What would become of poor wicked Negro, if Christ no
die for him?&nbsp; But he die for de chief of sinners, and dat 
make my heart sometimes quite glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of the Bible were you reading, 
William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me read how de man upon de cross spoke to Christ, and 
Christ spoke to him.&nbsp; Now dat man&rsquo;s prayer just do for
me; &lsquo;Lord, remember me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord, remember poor 
Negro sinner: dis is my prayer every morning, and sometimes at 
night too; when me cannot tink of many words, den me say de same 
again; Lord, remember poor Negro sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be sure, William, the Lord hears that prayer.&nbsp;
He pardoned and accepted the thief upon the cross, and he will 
not reject you; he will in no wise cast out any that come to 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I believe it; but dere is so much sin in my 
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
107</span>heart, it makes me afraid and sorry.&nbsp; Massa, do 
you see dese limpets, <a name="citation107"></a><a 
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a> how fast dey stick
to de rocks here?&nbsp; Just so, sin sticks fast to my 
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so, William; but take another comparison: do 
you cleave to Jesus Christ, by faith in his death and 
righteousness, as those limpets cleave to the rock, and neither 
seas nor storms shall separate you from his love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat is just what me want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, William, is not that very sin which you speak 
of a burden to you?&nbsp; You do not love it; you would be glad 
to obtain strength against it, and to be freed from it; would you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes; me give all dis world, if me had it, to be 
without sin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come then, and welcome, to Jesus Christ, my brother; 
his blood cleanseth from all sin.&nbsp; He gave himself as a 
ransom for sinners.&nbsp; He hath borne our grief, and carried 
our sorrows.&nbsp; He was wounded for our transgressions; he was 
bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was 
upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.&nbsp; The Lord hath
laid on him the iniquity of us all.&nbsp; Come, freely come to 
Jesus, the Saviour of sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa,&rdquo; said the poor fellow, weeping, 
&ldquo;me will come: but me come very slow; very slow, massa: me 
want to run, me want to fly.&nbsp; Jesus is very goot to poor 
Negro, to send you to tell him all dis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is not the first time you have heard these 
truths!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; dey have been comfort to my soul many times, 
<!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
108</span>since me hear goot minister preach in America, as me 
tell you last week at your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now I hope, William, that since God has been so 
graciously pleased to open your eyes, and affect your mind with 
such a great sense of his goodness in giving his Son to die for 
your sake; I hope that you do your endeavour to keep his 
commandments: I hope you strive to behave well to your master and
mistress, and fellow-servants.&nbsp; He that is a Christian 
inwardly will be a Christian outwardly; he that truly and 
savingly believes in Christ, will show his faith by his works, as
the apostle says.&nbsp; Is it not so, William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; me want to do so.&nbsp; Me want to be 
faithful.&nbsp; Me sorry to tink how bat servant me was before de
goot tings of Jesus Christ come to my heart.&nbsp; Me wish to do 
well to my massa, when he see me and when he not see; for me know
God always see me.&nbsp; Me know dat if me sin against mine own 
massa, me sin against God, and God be very angry with me.&nbsp; 
Beside, how can me love Christ if me do not what Christ tell 
me?&nbsp; Me love my fellow-servants, dough, as I tell you 
before, dey do not much love me; and I pray God to bless 
dem.&nbsp; And when dey say bat tings, and try to make me angry, 
den me tink, if Jesus Christ were in poor Negro&rsquo;s place, he
would not revile and answer again with bat words and temper, but 
he say little and pray much.&nbsp; And so den me say noting at 
all, but pray to God to forgive dem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more I conversed with this African convert, the more 
satisfactory were the evidences of his mind being spiritually 
enlightened, and his heart effectually wrought upon by the grace 
of God.</p>
<p><!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>The circumstances of the place in which we met together
contributed much to the interesting effect which the conversation
produced on my mind.&nbsp; The little cove or bay was beautiful 
in the extreme.&nbsp; The air was calm and serene.&nbsp; The sun 
shone, but we were sheltered from its rays by the cliffs.&nbsp; 
One of these was stupendously lofty and large.&nbsp; It was white
as snow; its summit hung directly over our heads.&nbsp; The 
sea-fowls were flying around it.&nbsp; Its whiteness was 
occasionally chequered with dark green masses of samphire, which 
grew there.&nbsp; On the other side, and behind us, was a more 
gradual declivity of many-coloured earths, interspersed with 
green patches of grass and bushes, and little streams of water 
trickling down the bank, and mingling with the sea at the 
bottom.&nbsp; At our feet the waves were advancing over shelves 
of rocks covered with a great variety of sea-weeds, which swam in
little fragments, and displayed much beauty and elegance of form 
as they were successively thrown upon the sand.</p>
<p>Ships of war and commerce were seen at different 
distances.&nbsp; Fishermen were plying their trade in boats 
nearer the shore.&nbsp; The noise of the flowing tide, combined 
with the voices of the sea-gulls over our heads, and now and then
a distant gun fired from the ships as they passed along, added 
much to the peculiar sensations to which the scene gave 
birth.&nbsp; Occasionally the striking of oars upon the waves, 
accompanied by the boatmen&rsquo;s song, met the ear.&nbsp; The 
sheep aloft upon the down sometimes mingled their bleatings with 
the other sounds.&nbsp; Thus all nature seemed to unite in 
impressing an attentive observer&rsquo;s heart with affecting 
thoughts.</p>
<p>I remained for a considerable time in conversation with <!-- 
page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
110</span>the Negro, finding that his master was gone from home 
for the day, and had given him liberty for some hours.&nbsp; I 
spoke to him on the nature, duty, and privilege of Christian 
baptism; pointed out to him, from a prayer-book which I had with 
me, the clear and scriptural principles of our own church upon 
that head; and found that he was very desirous of conforming to 
them.&nbsp; He appeared to me to be well qualified for receiving 
that sacramental pledge of his Redeemer&rsquo;s love; and I 
rejoiced in the prospect of beholding him no longer a 
&ldquo;stranger and foreigner, but a fellow-citizen with the 
saints, and of the household of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;has promised to 
&lsquo;sprinkle many nations,&rsquo; not only with the waters of 
baptism, but also with the dews of his heavenly grace.&nbsp; He 
says he will not only &lsquo;pour water on him that is 
thirsty,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, 
and my blessing upon thine offspring.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he can make me to be
clean in heart, and of a right Spirit; he can purge me with 
hyssop, and I shall be clean; he can wash me, and I shall be 
whiter dan snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God give you these blessings, and confirm you in 
every good gift!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much pleased with the affectionate manner in which he 
spoke of his parents, from whom he had been stolen in his 
childhood; and his wishes that God might direct them by some 
means to the knowledge of the Saviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but some of these 
ships may be carrying a missionary to the country where they 
live, to declare the good news of salvation to your countrymen, 
<!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>and to your own dear parents in particular, if they are
yet alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear fader and moder!&nbsp; My dear gracious 
Saviour,&rdquo; exclaimed he, leaping from the ground as he 
spoke, &ldquo;if dou wilt but save deir souls, and tell dem what 
dou hast done for sinner; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and seemed much affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will now pray with 
you, for your own soul, and for those of your parents 
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, massa; dat is very good and kind: do pray for poor 
Negro souls here and everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new and solemn &ldquo;house of prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The sea-sand was our floor, the heavens were our roof, the 
cliffs, the rocks, the hills, and the waves, formed the walls of 
our chamber.&nbsp; It was not, indeed, a &ldquo;place where 
prayer was wont to be made;&rdquo; but for this once it became a 
hallowed spot: it will by me ever be remembered as such.&nbsp; 
The presence of God was there.&nbsp; I prayed: the Negro 
wept.&nbsp; His heart was full.&nbsp; I felt with him, and could 
not but weep likewise.</p>
<p>The last day will show whether our tears were not the tears of
sincerity and Christian love.</p>
<p>It was time for my return.&nbsp; I leaned upon his arm as we 
ascended the steep cliff on my way back to my horse, which I had 
left at the top of the hill.&nbsp; Humility and thankfulness were
marked in his countenance.&nbsp; I leaned upon his arm with the 
feelings of a <i>brother</i>.&nbsp; It was a relationship I was 
happy to own.&nbsp; I took him by the hand at parting, appointed 
one more interview previous to the day of baptizing him, and bade
him farewell for the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my dear massa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, my fellow-Christian, for ever and 
ever!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>PART III.</h3>
<p>The interesting and affecting conversation which I had with 
the Negro servant produced a sensation not easy to be 
expressed.&nbsp; As I returned home, I was led into meditation on
the singular clearness and beauty of those evidences of faith and
conversion of heart to God, which I had just seen and 
heard.&nbsp; How plainly, I thought, it appears that salvation is
freely &ldquo;by grace through faith; and that not of ourselves; 
it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should 
boast.&rdquo;&nbsp; What but the Holy Spirit, who is the author 
and giver of the life of grace, could have wrought such a change 
from the once dark, perverse, and ignorant heathen, to this now 
convinced, enlightened, humble, and believing Christian!&nbsp; 
How manifestly is the uncontrolled sovereignty of the Divine will
exercised in the calling and translating of sinners from darkness
to light!&nbsp; What a lesson may the nominal Christian of a 
civilized country sometimes learn from the simple, sincere 
religion of a converted heathen!</p>
<p>I afterwards made particular inquiry into this young 
man&rsquo;s domestic and general deportment.&nbsp; Everything I 
heard was satisfactory, nor could I entertain a doubt respecting 
the consistency of his conduct and character.&nbsp; I had some 
further conversations with him, in the course of which I pursued 
such a plan of scriptural instruction and examination as I 
conceived to be the most suitable to his progressive state of 
mind.&nbsp; He improved much in reading, carried his Bible 
constantly with him, and took every opportunity which his duty to
his master&rsquo;s service would allow <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>for 
perusing it.&nbsp; I have frequently had occasion to observe that
amongst the truly religious poor, who have not had the advantage 
of being taught to read in early youth, a concern about the soul 
and a desire to know the word of God, have proved effectual 
motives for their learning to read with great ease and advantage 
to themselves and others.&nbsp; It was strikingly so in the 
present case.</p>
<p>I had, for a considerable time, been accustomed to meet some 
serious persons once a week, in a cottage at no great distance 
from the house where he lived, for the purpose of religious 
conversation, instruction, and prayer.&nbsp; Having found these 
occasions remarkably useful and interesting, I thought it would 
be very desirable to take the Negro there, in order that there 
might be other witnesses to the simplicity and sincerity of real 
Christianity, as exhibited in the character of this promising 
young convert.&nbsp; I hoped it might prove an eminent mean of 
grace to excite and quicken the spirit of prayer and praise 
amongst some of my parishioners, over whose spiritual progress I 
was anxiously watching.</p>
<p>I accordingly obtained his master&rsquo;s leave that he should
attend me to one of my cottage assemblies.&nbsp; His master, who 
was thoroughly convinced of the extraordinary change, in conduct 
and disposition, which religion had produced in his servant, was 
pleased with my attention to him, and always spoke well of his 
behaviour.</p>
<p>I set out on the day appointed for the interview.&nbsp; The 
cottage at which we usually assembled was nearly four miles 
distant from my own residence.&nbsp; My road lay along the foot 
of the hill mentioned in my last account of the Negro, from the 
summit of which so luxuriant a prospect was seen.&nbsp; On my 
right hand the steep acclivity of the hill <!-- page 114--><a 
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>intercepted
all prospect, except that of numerous sheep feeding on its rich 
and plentiful produce.&nbsp; Here and there the nearly 
perpendicular side of a chalk-pit varied the surface of the hill,
contrasting a dazzling white to the sober green of the 
surrounding bank.</p>
<p>On the left hand, at the distance of nearly half a mile, the 
tide flowed from the sea into a lake or haven of a considerable 
length and breadth.&nbsp; At one end of it, fishing and pilot 
vessels lay at anchor; at the other appeared the parish church, 
amongst the adjoining woods and fields.&nbsp; The bells were 
ringing; a gently swelling sound was brought along the surface of
the water, and an echo returned from a prominent part of the hill
beneath which I was riding.&nbsp; The whole scene was 
delightful.</p>
<p>I passed some rural and beautifully situated cottages, which 
seemed to be formed as fit residences for peace and tranquillity;
each was surrounded by a garden, and each had a little orchard or
field adjacent, where the husbandman&rsquo;s cow enjoyed her own 
pasture, and at the same time prepared rich provision for her 
owner&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Such was the wise and considerate 
allotment which the landlords and the farmers had <i>here</i> 
made for the labouring poor.&nbsp; The wholesome vegetable, the 
medicinal herb, and the sweet-scented flower, intermingled as 
they grew around these little dwellings, and reminded me, as I 
looked upon them, how comfortable is the lot of the industrious 
poor, whose hearts have learned the lesson of gratitude in the 
school of heavenly wisdom.&nbsp; For them as mercifully as for 
their richest neighbour, the sun shines, the rain descends, the 
earth brings forth her increase, the flower blossoms, the bird 
sings.&nbsp; Their wants are few, and contentment makes <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
115</span>them less.&nbsp; How great the blessing of being poor 
in this world, but rich in faith and a chosen inheritance in a 
better!</p>
<p>I knew that this was the character of some whose humble but 
neat and cleanly cottages I passed.&nbsp; A few such features in 
the prospect rendered it most lovely.&nbsp; Peace be to their 
memory, both as pilgrims and strangers here, and as ransomed 
souls whom I hope to meet in glory hereafter!</p>
<p>The house to which I was travelling was situated at the corner
of an oak wood, which screened it both from the burning heat of 
summer suns and the heavy blasts of winter south-west 
storms.&nbsp; As I approached it, I saw my friend the Negro 
sitting under a tree, and waiting my arrival.&nbsp; He held in 
his hand a little tract which I had given him; his Bible lay on 
the ground.&nbsp; He rose with much cheerfulness, 
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, massa, me very glad to see you; me tink you long 
time coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William, I hope you are well.&nbsp; I am going to take 
you with me to a few of my friends, who, I trust, are truly 
sincere in their religious pursuits.&nbsp; We meet every 
Wednesday evening for conversation about the things that belong 
to our everlasting peace, and I am sure you will be a welcome 
visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massa, me not goot enough to be with such goot 
people.&nbsp; Me great sinner; dey be goot Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to ask them, William, they would each tell 
you they were worse than others.&nbsp; Many of them were once, 
and that not very long ago, living in an openly sinful manner, 
ignorant of God, and the enemies of Jesus Christ by thought and 
deed.&nbsp; But divine grace stopped them in their wicked course,
and subdued their hearts to the love <!-- page 116--><a 
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and 
obedience of him and his gospel.&nbsp; You will only meet a 
company of poor fellow-sinners, who love to speak and sing the 
praises of redeeming love; and I am sure, William, that is a song
in which you will be willing to join them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, sir! dat song just do for poor Negro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we had arrived at the cottage garden gate.&nbsp; 
Several well-known faces appeared in and near the house, and the 
smile of affection welcomed us as we entered.&nbsp; It was known 
that the Negro was to visit the little society this evening, and 
satisfaction beamed on every countenance, as I took him by the 
hand and introduced him among them, saying, &ldquo;I have brought
a brother from Africa to see you, my friends.&nbsp; Bid him 
welcome in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said an humble and pious labourer, whose 
heart and tongue always overflowed with Christian kindness, 
&ldquo;we are at all times glad to see our dear minister, but 
especially so to-day in such company as you have brought with 
you.&nbsp; We have heard how merciful the Lord has been to 
him.&nbsp; Give me your hand, good friend (turning to the 
Negro).&nbsp; God be with you, here and everywhere; and blessed 
be his holy name for calling sinners, as I hope he has done you 
and me, to love and serve him for his mercy&rsquo;s 
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each one greeted him as he came into the house, and some 
addressed him in very kind and impressive language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massa,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;me not know what to say 
to all dese goot friends; me tink dis look a little like heaven 
upon earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then, with tears in his eyes&mdash;which, almost before he 
spoke, brought responsive drops into those of many 
present&mdash;<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>said, &ldquo;Goot friends and 
bredren in Christ Jesus, God bless you all, and bring you to 
heaven at de last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my stated custom, when I met to converse with these 
cottagers, to begin with prayer and reading a portion of the 
Scriptures.</p>
<p>When this was ended, I told the people present that the 
providence of God had placed this young man for a time under my 
ministry; and that, finding him seriously disposed, and believing
him to be very sincere in his religious profession, I had 
resolved on baptizing him, agreeably to his own wishes.&nbsp; I 
added, that I had now brought him with me to join in Christian 
conversation with us; for, as in olden times they that feared the
Lord spake often one to another, in testimony that they thought 
upon his name (Mal. iii. 16), so I hoped we were fulfilling a 
Christian and brotherly duty in thus assembling for mutual 
edification.</p>
<p>Addressing myself to the Negro, I said, &ldquo;William, tell 
me who made you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, de goot Fader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who redeemed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, his dear Son, who died for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sanctified you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holy Ghost, who teach me to know de goot Fader, and
his dear Son Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was your state by nature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me wicked sinner; me know noting but sin, me do noting 
but sin; my soul more black dan my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any change taken place in you since 
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me hope so, massa; but me sometime afraid 
no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are changed, who changed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;God de goot Fader, Jesus his dear Son, and God 
de Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was any change brought about in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God make me a slave when me was young little 
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, William? would you say God made you a 
slave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, massa, no: me mean, God let me be made slave by 
white men, to do me goot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to do you good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He take me from de land of darkness, and bring me to de
land of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which do you call the land of light? the West India 
Islands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, massa; dey be de land of Providence, but America be
de land of light to me; for dere me first hear goot minister 
preach.&nbsp; And now dis place where I am now is de land of more
light; for here you teach me more and more how goot Jesus is to 
sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the blood of Christ do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cleanse from all sin; and so me hope from my 
sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are then all men cleansed from sin by his 
blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, massa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are cleansed and saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dose dat have faith in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you prove that out of the Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir: &lsquo;He dat believeth on de Son hath 
everlasting life; and he dat believeth not de Son shall not see 
life, but de wrath of God abideth on him&rsquo;&rdquo; (John iii.
36).</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it to have faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me suppose dat it is to tink much about Jesus Christ, 
to love him much, to believe all he says to be true, to pray to 
him very much; and when me feel very weak and very <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>sinful, to tink dat he is very strong and very goot, 
and all dat for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you such a faith as you describe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, massa! me tink sometimes me have no faith at 
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so, William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When me want to tink about Jesus Christ, my mind run 
about after oder tings; when me want to love him, my heart soon 
quite cold; when me want to believe all to be true what he says 
to sinners, me den tink it is not true for me; when me want to 
pray, de devil put bat, very bat thoughts into me; and me never 
tank Christ enough.&nbsp; Now all dis make me sometimes afraid I 
have no faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I observed a very earnest glow of attention and fellow-feeling
in some countenances present, as he spoke these words I then 
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, William, I can prove that you have faith, 
notwithstanding your fears to the contrary.&nbsp; Answer me a few
more questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you begin to think yourself a great sinner, and to 
feel the want of a Saviour, of your own self, and by your own 
thoughts and doings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no; it came to me when me tink noting about it, and 
seek noting about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent the good minister in America to awaken your 
soul by his preaching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, very certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then began the work of serious thought in your 
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De goot God; me could not do it of myself, me sure of 
dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;Do you not think that Jesus Christ and his 
salvation are the one thing most needful and most 
desirable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, me quite sure of dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not believe that he is able to save 
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is able to save to de uttermost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he is not willing to save you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me dare not say dat.&nbsp; He is so goot, so merciful, 
so kind, to say he will in no wise cast out any dat come to 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish, and desire, and strive to keep his 
commandments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa, because me love him, and dat make me want 
to do as he say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to suffer for his sake, if God should 
call you to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me do tink me could die for de love of him: he not tink
it too much to die for wicked sinner; why should wicked sinner 
tink it much to die for so goot and righteous a 
Saviour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think and hope I may say to you, William, &lsquo;Thy 
faith hath made thee whole.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended my examination for the present.&nbsp; The other 
friends who were in the house listened with the most affectionate
anxiety to all that passed.&nbsp; One of them observed, not 
without evident emotion&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, sir, that though some men are white and some are
black, true Christianity is all of one colour.&nbsp; My own heart
has gone with this good man, every word he has spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so has mine,&rdquo; gently re-echoed from every 
part of the room.</p>
<p>After some time passed in more general conversation on <!-- 
page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>the subject of the Negro&rsquo;s history, I said, 
&ldquo;Let us now praise God for the rich and unspeakable gift of
his grace, and sing the hymn of redeeming love&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Now begin the heavenly theme,<br />
Sing aloud in Jesus&rsquo; name,&rsquo;&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which was accordingly done.&nbsp; Whatever might be the merit 
of the natural voices, it was evident there was spiritual melody 
in all their hearts.</p>
<p>The Negro was not much used to our way of singing, yet joined 
with great earnestness and affection, that showed how truly he 
felt what he uttered.&nbsp; When the fifth verse was 
ended&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing brought him from above,<br />
Nothing but redeeming love&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he repeated the words, almost unconscious where he 
was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, noting, noting but redeeming love, bring him down 
to poor William; noting but redeeming love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following verses were added and sung by way of 
conclusion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>See, a stranger comes to view,<br />
Though he&rsquo;s black, <a name="citation121"></a><a 
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a> he&rsquo;s comely 
too<br />
Comes to join the choirs above,<br />
Singing of redeeming love.</p>
<p>Welcome, Negro, welcome here,<br />
Banish doubt and banish fear;<br />
You, who Christ&rsquo;s salvation prove,<br />
Praise and bless redeeming love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I concluded with some remarks on the nature of salvation by 
grace, exhorting all present to press forward in the <!-- page 
122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>heavenly journey.&nbsp; It was an evening the 
circumstances of which, had they never been recorded on earth, 
were yet, doubtless, registered in the book of remembrance 
above.</p>
<p>I then fixed the day for the baptism of the Negro, and so took
leave of my little affectionate circle.</p>
<p>The moon shone bright as I returned home, and was beautifully 
reflected from the waters of the lake; harmony and repose 
characterized the scene.&nbsp; I had just been uniting in the 
praises of the God of grace and providence; and now the God of 
nature demanded a fresh tribute of thanksgiving for the beauties 
and comforts of creation; as David sang, &ldquo;When I consider 
thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, 
which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of 
him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few days the Negro was baptized, and not long after went 
on a voyage with his master.</p>
<p>Since that time I have not been able to hear any tidings of 
him.&nbsp; Whether he yet wanders as a pilgrim in this lower 
world, or whether he has joined the heavenly choir in the song of
&ldquo;redeeming love&rdquo; in glory, I know not.&nbsp; This I 
do know, he was a monument to the Lord&rsquo;s praise.&nbsp; He 
bore the impression of the Saviour&rsquo;s image on his heart, 
and exhibited the marks of divine grace in his life and 
conversation, with singular simplicity and unfeigned 
sincerity.</p>
<p>Give to God the glory.</p>
<h2><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>THE YOUNG COTTAGER.</h2>
<h3>PART I.</h3>
<p>When a serious Christian turns his attention to the barren 
state of the wilderness through which he is travelling, 
frequently must he heave a sigh for the sins and sorrows of his 
fellow-mortals.&nbsp; The renewed heart thirsts with holy desire 
that the Paradise which was lost through Adam may be fully 
regained in Christ.&nbsp; But the overflowings of sin within and 
without, the contempt of sacred institutions, the carelessness of
soul, the pride of unbelief, the eagerness of sensual appetite, 
the ambition for worldly greatness, and the deep-rooted enmity of
the carnal heart against God: these things are as &ldquo;the 
fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought,&rdquo; which distress
his soul, as he journeys through &ldquo;that great and terrible 
wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, like a solitary pilgrim, he weeps in secret places,
and rivers of water run down his eyes, because men keep not the 
law of God.</p>
<p>Occasionally he meets with a few fellow-travellers whose 
spirit is congenial with his own, and with whom he can <!-- page 
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
124</span>take &ldquo;sweet counsel together.&rdquo;&nbsp; They 
comfort and strengthen each other by the way.&nbsp; Each can 
relate something of the mercies of his God, and how kindly they 
have been dealt with, as they travelled onwards.&nbsp; The 
dreariness of the path is thus beguiled, and now and then, for a 
while, happy experiences of the divine consolation cheer their 
souls; &ldquo;the wilderness and the solitary place are glad for 
them; the desert rejoices and blossoms as the rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even at the very time when the Christian is taught to feel
the peace of God which passeth all understanding, to trust that 
he is personally interested in the blessings of salvation, and to
believe that God will promote his own glory by glorifying the 
penitent sinner; yet sorrows will mingle with his comforts, and 
he will rejoice, not without trembling, when he reflects on the 
state of other men.&nbsp; The anxieties connected with earthly 
relations are all alive in his soul, and, through the operation 
of the Spirit of God, become sanctified principles and motives 
for action.&nbsp; As the husband and father of a family; as the 
neighbour of the poor, the ignorant, the wicked, and the 
wretched; above all, as the spiritual overseer of the flock, if 
such be his holy calling, the heart which has been taught to feel
for its own case will abundantly feel for others.</p>
<p>But when he attempts to devise means in order to stem the 
torrent of iniquity, to instruct the ignorant, and to convert the
sinner from the error of his way, he cannot help crying out, 
&ldquo;Who is sufficient for these things?&rdquo;&nbsp; Unbelief 
passes over the question, and trembles.&nbsp; But faith quickly 
revives the inquirer with the cheerful assurance that &ldquo;our 
sufficiency is of God,&rdquo; and saith, &ldquo;Commit thy way 
unto the Lord, and he shall bring it to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>When he is thus affectionately engaged for the good of 
mankind, he will become seriously impressed with the necessity of
early attentions to the young in particular.&nbsp; Many around 
him are grown gray-headed in sin, and give but little prospect of
amendment.&nbsp; Many of the parents and heads of families are so
eagerly busied in the profits, pleasures, and occupations of the 
world, that they heed not the warning voice of their 
instructor.&nbsp; Many of their elder children are launching out 
into life, headstrong, unruly, &ldquo;earthly, sensual, 
devilish;&rdquo; they likewise treat the wisdom of God as if it 
were foolishness.&nbsp; But, under these discouragements, we may 
often turn with hope to the very young, to the little ones of the
flock, and endeavour to teach them to sing hosannas to the Son of
David, before their minds are wholly absorbed in the world and 
its allurements.&nbsp; We may trust that a blessing shall attend 
such labours, if undertaken in faith and simplicity, and that 
some at least of our youthful disciples, like Josiah, while they 
are yet young, may begin to seek after the God of their 
fathers.</p>
<p>Such an employment, especially when blessed by any actual 
instances of real good produced, enlivens the mind with hope, and
fills it with gratitude.&nbsp; We are thence led to trust that 
the next generation may become more fruitful unto God than the 
present, and the Church of Christ be replenished with many such 
as have been called into the vineyard &ldquo;early in the 
morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; And should our endeavours for a length of 
time apparently fail of success, yet we ought not to 
despair.&nbsp; Early impressions and convictions of conscience 
have sometimes lain dormant for years, and at last revived into 
gracious existence and maturity.&nbsp; It was <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>not said in
vain, &ldquo;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when 
he is old he will not depart from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a gratifying occupation it is to an affectionate mind, 
even in a way of nature, to walk through the fields, and lead a 
little child by the hand, enjoying its infantine prattle, and 
striving to improve the time by some kind word of 
instruction!&nbsp; I wish that every Christian pilgrim in the way
of grace, as he walks through the Lord&rsquo;s pastures, would 
try to lead at least one little child by the hand; and perhaps, 
whilst he is endeavouring to guide and preserve his young and 
feeble companion, the Lord will recompense him double for all his
cares by comforting his own heart in the attempt.&nbsp; The 
experiment is worth the trial.&nbsp; It is supported by this 
recollection,&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord will come with strong hand, 
and his arm shall rule for him; behold, his reward is with him, 
and his work before him.&nbsp; He shall feed his flock like a 
shepherd; he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them 
in his bosom, and <i>shall gently lead those that are with 
young</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shall plead no further apology for introducing to the notice
of my readers a few particulars relative to a young female 
cottager, whose memory is particularly endeared to me from the 
circumstance of her being, so far as I can trace or discover, my 
first-born spiritual child in the ministry of the gospel.&nbsp; 
She was certainly the first, of whose conversion to God, under my
own pastoral instruction, I can speak with precision and 
assurance.</p>
<p>Every parent of a family knows that there is a very 
interesting emotion of heart connected with the birth of his 
first-born child.&nbsp; Energies and affections, to which the 
mind has hitherto been almost a stranger, begin to unfold 
themselves <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>and expand into active existence 
when he first is hailed as a father.&nbsp; But may not the 
spiritual father be allowed the possession and indulgence of a 
similar sensation in his connection with the children whom the 
Lord gives him, as begotten through the ministry of the word of 
life!&nbsp; If the first-born child in nature be received as a 
new and acceptable blessing, how much more so the first-born 
child in grace!&nbsp; I claim this privilege, and crave 
permission, in writing what follows, to erect a monumental 
record, sacred to the memory of a dear little child, who, I 
trust, will at the last day prove my crown of rejoicing.</p>
<p>Jane S--- was the daughter of poor parents, in the village 
where it pleased God first to cast my lot in the ministry.&nbsp; 
My acquaintance with her commenced when she was twelve years of 
age by her weekly attendance at my house amongst a number of 
children whom I invited and regularly instructed every Saturday 
afternoon.</p>
<p>They used to read, repeat catechisms, psalms, hymns, and 
portions of Scripture.&nbsp; I accustomed them also to pass a 
kind of free conversational examination, according to their age 
and ability, in those subjects by which I hoped to see them made 
wise unto salvation.</p>
<p>On the summer evenings I frequently used to assemble this 
little group out of doors in my garden, sitting under the shade 
of some trees, which protected us from the heat of the sun; from 
hence a scene appeared, which rendered my occupation the more 
interesting.&nbsp; For adjoining the spot where we sat, and only 
separated from us by a fence, was the churchyard, surrounded with
beautiful prospects in every direction.</p>
<p>There lay the mortal remains of thousands, who, from age <!-- 
page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
128</span>to age, in their different generations, had been 
successively committed to the grave,&mdash;&ldquo;earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the once famed 
ancestors of the rich, and the less known forefathers of the poor
lay mingling their dust together, and alike waiting the 
resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>I had not far to look for subjects of warning and exhortation 
suitable to my little flock of lambs that I was feeding.&nbsp; I 
could point to the heaving sods that marked the different graves 
and separated them from each other, and tell my pupils that, 
young as they were, none of them were too young to die; and that 
probably more than half of the bodies which were buried there 
were those of little children.&nbsp; I hence took occasion to 
speak of the nature and value of a soul, and to ask them where 
they expected their souls to go when they departed hence and were
no more seen on earth.</p>
<p>I told them who was &ldquo;the resurrection and the 
life,&rdquo; and who alone could take away the sting of 
death.&nbsp; I used to remind them that the hour was 
&ldquo;coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear 
His voice, and shall come forth: they that have done good, unto 
the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the 
resurrection of damnation.&rdquo;&nbsp; I often availed myself of
these opportunities to call to their recollection the more recent
deaths of their own relatives that lay buried so near us.&nbsp; 
Some had lost a parent, others a brother or sister; some perhaps 
had lost all these, and were committed to the mercy of their 
neighbours as fatherless or motherless orphans.&nbsp; Such 
circumstances were occasionally useful to excite tender emotions,
favourable to serious impressions.</p>
<p><!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>Sometimes I sent the children to the various stones 
which stood at the head of the graves, and bid them learn the 
epitaphs inscribed upon them.&nbsp; I took pleasure in seeing the
little ones thus dispersed in the churchyard, each committing to 
memory a few verses written in commemoration of the 
departed.&nbsp; They would soon accomplish the desired object, 
and eagerly return to me ambitious to repeat their task.</p>
<p>Thus my churchyard became a book of instruction, and every 
grave-stone a leaf of edification for my young disciples.</p>
<p>The church itself stood in the midst of the ground.&nbsp; It 
was a spacious antique structure.&nbsp; Within those very walls I
first proclaimed the message of God to sinners.&nbsp; As these 
children surrounded me, I sometimes pointed to the church, spoke 
to them of the nature of public worship, the value of the 
Sabbath, the duty of regular attendance on its services, and 
urged their serious attention to the means of grace.&nbsp; I 
showed them the sad state of many countries, where neither 
churches nor Bibles were known, and the no less melancholy 
condition of multitudes at home, who sinfully neglect worship and
slight the word of God.&nbsp; I thus tried to make them sensible 
of their own favours and privileges.</p>
<p>Neither was I at a loss for another class of objects around me
from which I could draw useful instruction; for many of the 
beauties of created nature appealed in view.</p>
<p>Eastward of us extended a large river or lake of sea-water, 
chiefly formed by the tide, and nearly enclosed by land.&nbsp; 
Beyond this was a fine bay and road for ships, filled with 
vessels of every size, from the small sloop or cutter to the 
first-rate man-of-war.&nbsp; On the right hand of the haven rose 
a hill of peculiarly beautiful form and considerable 
height.&nbsp; Its verdure was very rich, and many hundred sheep 
graced <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>upon its sides and summit.&nbsp; 
From the opposite shore of the same water a large sloping extent 
of bank was diversified with fields, woods, hedges, and 
cottages.&nbsp; At its extremity stood, close to the edge of the 
sea itself, the remains of the tower of an ancient church, still 
preserved as a sea-mark.&nbsp; Far beyond the bay, a very distant
shore was observable, and land beyond it; trees, towns, and other
buildings appeared, more especially when gilded by the reflected 
rays of the sun.</p>
<p>To the south-westward of the garden was another down, covered 
also with flocks of sheep, and a portion of it fringed with 
trees.&nbsp; At the foot of this hill lay the village, a part of 
which gradually ascended to the rising ground on which the church
stood.</p>
<p>From the intermixture of houses with gardens, orchards, and 
trees, it presented a very pleasing aspect.&nbsp; Several fields 
adjoined the garden on the east and north, where a number of 
cattle were pasturing.&nbsp; My own little shrubberies and 
flower-beds variegated the view, and recompensed my toil in 
rearing them, as well by their beauty as their fragrance.</p>
<p>Had the sweet psalmist of Israel sat in this spot, he would 
have glorified God the Creator by descanting on these his 
handiworks.&nbsp; I cannot write psalms like David, but I wish, 
in my own poor way, to praise the Lord for his goodness, and to 
show forth his wonderful works to the children of men.&nbsp; But 
had David been also surrounded with a troop of young scholars in 
such a situation, he would once more have said, &ldquo;Out of the
mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained 
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I love to retrace these scenes; they are past, but the 
recollection is sweet.</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>I love to retrace them, for they bring to my mind many 
former mercies, which ought not, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, to be
forgotten.</p>
<p>I love to retrace them, for they reassure me that, in the 
course of that private ministerial occupation, God was pleased to
give me so valuable a fruit of my labours.</p>
<p>Little Jane used constantly to appear on these weekly seasons 
of instruction.&nbsp; I made no very particular observations 
concerning her during the first twelve months or more after her 
commencement of attendance.&nbsp; She was not then remarkable for
any peculiar attainment.&nbsp; On the whole, I used to think her 
rather more slow of apprehension than most of her 
companions.&nbsp; She usually repeated her tasks correctly, but 
was seldom able to make answers to questions for which she was 
not previously prepared with replies&mdash;a kind of extempore 
examination, in which some of the children excelled.&nbsp; Her 
countenance was not engaging; her eye discovered no remarkable 
liveliness.&nbsp; She read tolerably well, took pains, and 
improved in it.</p>
<p>Mildness and quietness marked her general demeanour.&nbsp; She
was very constant in her attendance on public worship at the 
church, as well as on my Saturday instruction at home.&nbsp; But,
generally speaking, she was little noticed, except for her 
regular and orderly conduct.&nbsp; Had I then been asked of which
of my young scholars I had formed the most favourable opinion, 
poor Jane might have been altogether omitted in the list.</p>
<p>How little do we oftentimes know what God is doing in other 
people&rsquo;s hearts!&nbsp; What poor calculators and judges we 
frequently prove till he opens our eyes!&nbsp; His thoughts are 
not our thoughts; neither our ways his ways.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Once, indeed, during the latter part of that year, I 
was struck with her ready attention to my wishes.&nbsp; I had, 
agreeably to the plan above mentioned, sent her into the 
churchyard to commit to memory an epitaph which I admired.&nbsp; 
On her return she told me that, in addition to what I desired, 
she had also learned another, which was inscribed on an adjoining
stone, adding, that she thought it a very pretty one.</p>
<p>I thought so too, and perhaps my readers will be of the same 
opinion.&nbsp; Little Jane, though dead, yet shall speak.&nbsp; 
While I transcribe the lines, I can powerfully imagine that I 
hear her voice repeating them.&nbsp; The idea is exceedingly 
gratifying to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>EPITAPH ON MRS. A. B.</p>
<p>Forgive, blest shade, the tributary tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That mourns a thy exit from a world like this;<br />
Forgive the wish that would have kept thee here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stayed thy progress to the seats of bliss.</p>
<p>No more confined to grovelling scenes of night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more a tenant pent in mortal clay;<br />
Now should we rather hail thy glorious flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trace thy journey to the realms of day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above was her appointed task; and the other, which she 
voluntarily learned and spoke of with pleasure, is 
this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>EPITAPH ON THE STONE ADJOINING.</p>
<p>It must be so&mdash;Our father Adam&rsquo;s fall,<br />
And disobedience, brought this lot on all.<br />
All die in him&mdash;But, hopeless should we be,<br />
Blest Revelation! were it not for thee.<br />
Hail, glorious Gospel! heavenly light, whereby<br />
We live with comfort, and with comfort die;<br />
And view, beyond this gloomy scene the tomb<br />
A life of endless happiness to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>I afterwards discovered that the sentiment expressed in
the latter epitaph had much affected her, but at the period of 
this little incident I knew nothing of her mind; I had 
comparatively overlooked her.&nbsp; I have often been sorry for 
it since.&nbsp; Conscience seemed to rebuke me when I afterwards 
discovered what the Lord had been doing for her soul, as if I had
neglected her, yet it was not done designedly.&nbsp; She was 
unknown to us all, except that, as I since found out, her 
regularity and abstinence from the sins and follies of her young 
equals in age and station brought upon her many taunts and jeers 
from others, which she bore very meekly; but at that time I knew 
it not.</p>
<p>I was young myself in the ministry, and younger in Christian 
experience.&nbsp; My parochial plans had not as yet assumed such 
a principle of practical order and inquiry as to make me 
acquainted with the character and conduct of each family and 
individual in my flock.</p>
<p>I was then quite a learner, and had much to learn.</p>
<p>And what am I now?&nbsp; A learner still; and if I have 
learned anything, it is this, that I have every day more and more
yet to learn.&nbsp; Of this I am certain, that my young scholar 
soon became my teacher.&nbsp; I <i>first</i> saw what true 
religion could accomplish in witnessing her experience of 
it.&nbsp; The Lord once &ldquo;called a little child unto him, 
and set him in the midst of his disciples&rdquo; as an emblem and
an illustration of his doctrine.&nbsp; But the Lord did more in 
the case of little Jane.&nbsp; He not only called <i>her</i> as a
child to show, by a similitude, what conversion means, but he 
also called her by his grace to be a vessel of mercy, and a 
living witness of that almighty power and love by which her own 
heart was turned to God.</p>
<h3><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>PART II.</h3>
<p>There is no illustration of the nature and character of the 
Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom on earth which is more grateful to 
contemplation, than that of the shepherd and his flock.&nbsp; 
Imagination has been accustomed, from our earliest childhood, to 
wander amongst the fabled retreats of the Arcadian 
shepherds.&nbsp; We have probably often delighted ourselves in 
our own native country, by witnessing the interesting occupation 
of the pastoral scene.&nbsp; The shepherd, tending his flock on 
the side of some spacious hill, or in the hollow of a sequestered
valley; folding them at night, and guarding them against all 
danger; leading them from one pasture to another, or for 
refreshment to the cooling waters.&nbsp; These objects have met 
and gratified our eyes, as we travelled through the fields, and 
sought out creation&rsquo;s God, amidst creation&rsquo;s 
beauties.&nbsp; The poet and the painter have each lent their aid
to cherish our delight in these imaginations.&nbsp; Many a 
descriptive verse has strengthened our attachment to the pastoral
scene, and many a well-wrought picture has occasioned it to glow 
like a reality in our ideas.</p>
<p>But far more impressively than these causes can possibly 
affect, has the word of God endeared the subject to our hearts, 
and sanctified it to Christian experience.&nbsp; Who does not 
look back with love and veneration to those days of holy 
simplicity, when patriarchs of the church of God lived in tents 
and watched their flocks?&nbsp; With what a strength and beauty 
of allusion do the prophets refer to the intercourse between the 
shepherd and flock for an illustration of the Saviour&rsquo;s 
kingdom on earth!&nbsp; The Psalmist rejoiced in the <!-- page 
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
135</span>consideration that the Lord was his Shepherd, and that 
therefore he should not want.&nbsp; The Redeemer himself assumed 
this interesting title, and declared that &ldquo;his sheep hear 
his voice, he knows them, and they follow him, and he gives unto 
them eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps at no previous moment was this comparison ever 
expressed so powerfully, as when his risen Lord gave the pastoral
charge to the lately offending but now penitent disciple, saying,
&ldquo;Feed my sheep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every principle of grace, 
mercy, and peace, met together on that occasion.&nbsp; Peter had 
thrice denied his Master: his Master now thrice asked him, 
&ldquo;Lovest thou me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter each time appealed to 
his own, or to his Lord&rsquo;s consciousness of what he felt 
within his heart.&nbsp; As often Jesus commited to his care the 
flock which he had purchased with his blood.&nbsp; And that none 
might be forgotten, he not only said, &ldquo;Feed my 
sheep,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Feed my lambs,&rdquo; also.</p>
<p>May every instructor of the young keep this injunction 
enforced on his conscience and affections,&mdash;I return to 
little Jane.</p>
<p>It was about fifteen months from the first period of her 
attendance on my Saturday school, when I missed her from her 
customary place.&nbsp; Two or three weeks had gone by, without my
making any particular inquiry respecting her.&nbsp; I was at 
length informed that she was not well; but apprehending no 
peculiar cause for alarm, nearly two months passed away without 
any further mention of her name being made.</p>
<p>At length a poor old woman in the village, of whose religious 
disposition I had formed a good opinion, came and said to me, 
&ldquo;Sir, have you not missed Jane S--- at your house on 
Saturday afternoons?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I believe she is 
not well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor ever will be, I fear,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you apprehend any danger in the 
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, she is very poorly indeed, and I think is in a 
decline.&nbsp; She wants to see you, sir; but is afraid you would
not come to see such a poor young child as she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not go where poverty and sickness may call me?&nbsp; 
How can she imagine so?&nbsp; At which house does she 
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, it is a poor place, and she is ashamed to ask you 
to come there.&nbsp; Her near neighbours are noisy wicked people,
and her own father and mother are strange folks.&nbsp; They all 
make game at poor Jenny because she reads her Bible so 
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not tell me about poor places and wicked people: 
that is the very situation where a minister of the gospel is 
called to do the most good.&nbsp; I shall go to see her; you may 
let her know my intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir; I go in most days to speak to her, and it 
does one&rsquo;s heart good to hear her talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what does she talk 
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about, poor thing! why, nothing but good things, 
such as the Bible, and Jesus Christ, and life, and death, and her
soul, and heaven, and hell, and your discourses, and the books 
you used to teach her, sir.&nbsp; Her father says he&rsquo;ll 
have no such godly things in his house; and her own mother scoffs
at her, and says she supposes Jenny counts herself better than 
other folks.&nbsp; But she does not mind all that.&nbsp; She will
read her books, and then talk so pretty to her mother, and beg 
that she would think about her soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord forgive me,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;for not 
being more attentive to this poor child&rsquo;s 
case!&rdquo;&nbsp; I seemed to feel the <!-- page 137--><a 
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>importance 
of infantine instruction more than ever I had done before, and 
felt a rising hope that this girl might prove a kind of 
first-fruits of my labours.</p>
<p>I now recollected her quiet, orderly, diligent attendance on 
our little weekly meetings; and her marked approbation of the 
epitaph, as related in my last paper, rushed into my 
thoughts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope, I really hope,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;this dear child will prove a true child of God.&nbsp; And 
if so, what a mercy to her, and what a mercy for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p137.jpg">
<img alt="Little Jane&rsquo;s Cottage" src="images/p137.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The next morning I went to see the child.&nbsp; Her dwelling 
was of the humblest kind.&nbsp; It stood against a high bank of 
earth, which formed a sort of garden behind it.&nbsp; It was so 
steep, that but little would grow in it; yet that little served 
to show not only, on the one hand, the poverty of its owners, but
also to illustrate the happy truth, that even in the worst of 
circumstances the Lord does make a kind provision for the support
of his creatures.&nbsp; The front aspect of the cottage was 
chiefly rendered pleasing by a honeysuckle, which luxuriantly 
climbed up the wall, enclosing the door, windows, and even the 
chimney, with its twining branches.&nbsp; As I entered the 
house-door, its flowers put forth a very sweet and refreshing 
smell.&nbsp; Intent on the object of my visit, I at the same 
moment offered up silent prayer to God, and entertained a hope, 
that the welcome fragrance of the shrub might be illustrative of 
that all-prevailing intercession of a Redeemer, which I trusted 
was, in the case of this little child, as &ldquo;a sweet-smelling
savour&rdquo; to her heavenly Father.&nbsp; The very flowers and 
leaves of the garden and field are emblematical of higher things,
when grace teaches us to make them so.&nbsp; Jane was in bed 
upstairs.&nbsp; I found no one in the house <!-- page 138--><a 
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>with her 
except the woman who had brought me the message on the evening 
before.&nbsp; The instant I looked on the girl, I perceived a 
very marked change in her countenance: it had acquired the 
consumptive hue, both white and red.&nbsp; A delicacy unknown to 
it before quite surprised me, owing to the alteration it produced
in her look.&nbsp; She received me first with a very sweet smile,
and then instantly burst into a flood of tears, just sobbing 
out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to see you, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much concerned at your being so ill, my 
child, and grieved that I was not sooner aware of your 
state.&nbsp; But I hope the Lord designs it for your 
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eye, not her tongue, powerfully expressed,
&ldquo;I hope and think he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my poor child, since you can no longer come to 
see me, I will come and see you, and we will talk over the 
subjects which I have been used to explain to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir, I shall be so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I believe she will,&rdquo; said the woman; 
&ldquo;for she loves to talk of nothing so much as what she has 
heard you say in your sermons, and in the books you have given 
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really desirous, my dear child, to be a true 
Christian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, sir; I am sure I desire that above all 
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was astonished and delighted at the earnestness and 
simplicity with which she spoke these words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;I have been thinking, as 
I lay on my bed for many weeks past, how good you are to instruct
us poor children; what must become of us without it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly glad to perceive that my instructions have 
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
139</span>not been lost upon you, and pray God that this your 
present sickness may be an instrument of blessing in his hands to
prove, humble, and sanctify you.&nbsp; My dear child, you have a 
soul, an immortal soul to think of; you remember what I have 
often said to you about the value of a soul: &lsquo;What shall it
profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own 
soul?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I remember well you told us, that when our 
bodies are put into the grave, our souls will then go either to 
the good or the bad place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to which of these places do you think that, as a 
sinner in the sight of God, you deserve to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the bad one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! to everlasting destruction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am a great sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And must all great sinners go to hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all deserve it; and I am sure I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there no way of escape?&nbsp; Is there no way 
for a great sinner to be saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Christ is the Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whom does he save?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All believers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you believe in Christ yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, sir; I wish I did; but I feel that I 
love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you love him for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is good to poor children&rsquo;s souls like 
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he done for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died for me, sir; and what could he do 
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;And what do you hope to gain by his 
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good place when I die, if I believe in him, and love 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you felt any uneasiness on account of your 
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, a great deal.&nbsp; When you used to talk
to us children on Saturdays, I often felt as if I could hardly 
bear it, and wondered that others could seem so careless.&nbsp; I
thought I was not fit to die.&nbsp; I thought of all the bad 
things I had ever done and said, and believed God must be very 
angry with me; for you often told us, that God would not be 
mocked; and that Christ said, if we were not converted, we could 
not go to heaven.&nbsp; Sometimes I thought I was so young it did
not signify: and then, again, it seemed to me a great sin to 
think so; for I knew I was old enough to see what was right and 
what was wrong; and so God had a just right to be angry when I 
did wrong.&nbsp; Besides, I could see that my heart was not 
right; and how could such a heart be fit for heaven?&nbsp; 
Indeed, sir, I used to feel very uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jenny, I wish I had known all this 
before.&nbsp; Why did you never tell me about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I durst not.&nbsp; Indeed, I could not well say 
what was the matter with me: and I thought you would look upon me
as very bold, if I had spoke about myself to such a gentleman as 
you: yet I often wished that you knew what I felt and 
feared.&nbsp; Sometimes, as we went away from your house, I could
not help crying; and then the other children laughed and jeered 
at me, and said I was going to be very good, they supposed, or at
least to make people think so.&nbsp; Sometimes, sir, I fancied 
you did not think so well of me as of the rest, and that hurt me;
yet I knew I deserved no particular favour, because I was the 
chief of sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;My dear, what made St. Paul say he was chief of 
sinners?&nbsp; In what verse of the Bible do you find this 
expression, &lsquo;the chief of sinners;&rsquo; can you repeat 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all 
acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save 
sinners;&rsquo;&mdash;is not that right, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child, it is right; and I hope that the same 
conviction which St. Paul had at that moment has made you 
sensible of the same truth.&nbsp; Christ came into the world to 
save sinners: my dear child, remember now and for ever more, that
Christ came into the world to save the chief of 
sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am so glad he did.&nbsp; It makes me hope that 
he will save me, though I am a poor sinful girl.&nbsp; Sir, I am 
very ill, and I do not think I shall ever get well again.&nbsp; I
want to go to Christ if I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Christ while you live, my dear child, and he will
not cast you away when you die.&nbsp; He that said, &lsquo;Suffer
little children to come unto me,&rsquo; waits to be gracious to 
them, and forbids them not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you first think so seriously about the state 
of your soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your talking about the graves in the churchyard, and 
telling us how many young children were buried there.&nbsp; I 
remember you said, one day, near twelve months ago, 
&lsquo;Children! where will you be a hundred years hence?&nbsp; 
Children! where do you think you shall go when you die?&nbsp; 
Children! if you were to die to-night, are you sure you should go
to Christ and be happy?&rsquo;&nbsp; Sir, I never shall forget 
your saying, &lsquo;Children,&rsquo; three times together in that
solemn way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;Did you ever before that day feel any desire 
about your soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I think I first had that desire almost as 
soon as you began to teach us on Saturday afternoons; but on that
day I felt as I never did before.&nbsp; I shall never forget 
it.&nbsp; All the way as I went home, and all that night, these 
words were in my thoughts: &lsquo;Children! where do you think 
you shall go when you die?&rsquo;&nbsp; I thought I must leave 
off all my bad ways, or where shall I go when I died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what effect did these thoughts produce in your 
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I tried to live better, and I did leave off many 
bad ways; but the more I strove, the more difficult I found it, 
my heart seemed so hard: and then I could not tell any one my 
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could not you tell it to the Lord, who hears and 
answers prayers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My prayers (here she blushed and sighed) are very poor 
at the best, and at that time I scarcely knew how to pray at all 
as I ought.&nbsp; But I did sometimes ask the Lord for a better 
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a character in all this conversation which marked a 
truly sincere and enlightened state of mind.&nbsp; She spoke with
all the simplicity of a child, and yet the seriousness of a 
Christian.&nbsp; I could scarcely persuade myself that she was 
the same girl I had been accustomed to see in past time.&nbsp; 
Her countenance was filled with interesting affections, and 
always spoke much more than her tongue could utter.&nbsp; At the 
same time she now possessed an ease and liberty in speaking, to 
which she had formerly been a stranger: nevertheless, she was 
modest, humble, and unassuming.&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Her 
readiness to converse was the result of spiritual anxiety, not 
childish forwardness.&nbsp; The marks of a Divine change were too
prominent to be easily mistaken; and in this very child, I, for 
the first time, witnessed the evident testimonies of such a 
change.&nbsp; How encouraging, how profitable to my own soul!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; continued little Jane, &ldquo;I had one day
been thinking that I was neither fit to live nor die: for I could
find no comfort in this world, and I was sure I deserved none in 
the other.&nbsp; On that day you sent me to learn the verse on 
Mrs. B---&rsquo;s headstone, and then I read that on the one next
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very well remember it, Jenny; you came back, and 
repeated them both to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were two lines in it which made me think and 
meditate a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which were they?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hail Glorious gospel! heavenly 
light, whereby<br />
We live with comfort, and with comfort die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wished that glorious gospel was mine, that I might live and 
die with comfort; and it seemed as if I thought it would be 
so.&nbsp; I never felt so happy in all my life before.&nbsp; The 
words were often in my thoughts,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Live with comfort, and with comfort 
die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glorious gospel, indeed!&nbsp; I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, what is the meaning of the word 
gospel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news for whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For wicked sinners, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>&ldquo;Who sends this good news for wicked 
sinners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who brings this good news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, <i>you</i> brought it to <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here my soul melted in an instant, and I could not repress the
tears which the emotion excited.&nbsp; The last answer was 
equally unexpected and affecting.&nbsp; I felt a father&rsquo;s 
tenderness and gratitude for a new and first-born child.</p>
<p>Jane wept likewise.</p>
<p>After a little pause she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O sir!&nbsp; I wish you would speak to my father, and 
mother, and little brother; for I am afraid they are going on 
very badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, they drink, and swear, and quarrel, and do not 
like what is good; and it does grieve me so, I cannot bear 
it.&nbsp; If I speak a word to them about it, they are very 
angry, and laugh, and bid me be quiet, and not set up for their 
teacher.&nbsp; Sir, I am ashamed to tell you this of them, but I 
hope it is not wrong; I mean it for their good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish your prayers and endeavours for their sake may 
be blessed; I will also do what I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then prayed with the child, and promised to visit her 
constantly.</p>
<p>As I returned home, my heart was filled with thankfulness for 
what I had seen and heard.&nbsp; Little Jane appeared to be a 
first-fruits of my parochial and spiritual harvest.&nbsp; This 
thought greatly comforted and strengthened me in my ministerial 
prospects.</p>
<p>My partiality to the memory of little Jane will probably 
induce me to lay some further particulars before the reader.</p>
<h3><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>PART III.</h3>
<p>Divine grace educates the reasoning faculties of the soul, as 
well as the best affections of the heart; and happily consecrates
them both to the glory of the Redeemer.&nbsp; Neither the 
disadvantages of poverty, nor the inexperience of childhood, are 
barriers able to resist the mighty influences of the Spirit of 
God, when &ldquo;he goeth forth where he listeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to 
confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the 
world to confound the things which are mighty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
truth of this scriptural assertion was peculiarly evident in the 
case of my young parishioner.</p>
<p>Little Jane&rsquo;s illness was of a lingering nature.&nbsp; I
often visited her.&nbsp; The soul of this young Christian was 
gradually, but effectually, preparing for heaven.&nbsp; I have 
seldom witnessed in any older person, under similar 
circumstances, stronger marks of earnest inquiry, continual 
seriousness, and holy affections.&nbsp; One morning, as I was 
walking through the church-yard, in my way to visit her, I 
stopped to look at the epitaph which had made such a deep 
impression on her mind.&nbsp; I was struck with the reflection of
the important consequences which might result from a more 
frequent and judicious attention to the inscriptions placed in 
our burying-grounds, as memorials of the departed.&nbsp; The idea
occurred to my thoughts, that as the two stone tables given by 
God to Moses were once a means of communicating to the Jews, from
age to age, the revelation of God&rsquo;s will as concerning the 
law; so these funeral tables of stone may, under a better 
dispensation, bear a never-failing proclamation <!-- page 
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>of
God&rsquo;s will to sinners as revealed in the gospel of his 
grace, from generation to generation.&nbsp; I have often 
lamented, when indulging a contemplation among the graves, that 
some of the inscriptions were coarse and ridiculous; others, 
absurdly flattering; many, expressive of sentiments at variance 
with the true principles of the word of God; not a few, barren 
and unaccompanied with a single word of useful instruction to the
reader.&nbsp; Thus a very important opportunity of conveying 
scriptural admonition is lost.&nbsp; I wish that every 
grave-stone might not only record the name of our deceased 
friends, but also proclaim the name of Jesus, as the only name 
given under heaven whereby men can be saved.&nbsp; Perhaps, if 
the ministers of religion were to interest themselves in this 
matter, and accustom their people to consult them as to the 
nature of the monumental inscriptions which they wish to 
introduce into churches and church-yards, a gradual improvement 
would take place in this respect.&nbsp; What is offensive, 
useless, or erroneous, would no longer find admittance, and a 
succession of valuable warning and consolation to the living 
would perpetuate the memory of the dead.</p>
<p>What can be more disgusting than the too common spectacle of 
trifling licentious travellers, wandering about the church-yards 
of the different places through which they pass, in search of 
rude, ungrammatical, ill-spelt, and absurd verses among the 
grave-stones; and this for the gratification of their unholy 
scorn and ridicule!&nbsp; And yet how much is it to be deplored 
that such persons are seldom disappointed in finding many 
instances which too readily afford them the unfeeling 
satisfaction which they seek!&nbsp; I therefore offer this 
suggestion to my reverend brethren, that as no monument or stone 
can be placed in a church or church-yard <!-- page 147--><a 
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>without 
their express consent or approbation, whether one condition of 
that consent being granted, should not be a previous inspection 
and approval of every inscription which may be so placed within 
the precincts of the sanctuary?</p>
<p>The reader will pardon this digression, which evidently arose 
from the peculiar connection established in little Jane&rsquo;s 
history, between an epitaph inscribed on a grave-stone, and the 
word of God inscribed on her heart.&nbsp; When I arrived at 
Jane&rsquo;s cottage, I found her in bed, reading Dr. 
Watts&rsquo; Hymns for Children, in which she took great 
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you reading this morning, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have been thinking very much about some verses 
in my little book.&nbsp; Here they are,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There is an hour when I must die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor do I know how soon &rsquo;twill come;<br />
A thousand children young as I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are called by death to hear their doom.</p>
<p>Let me improve the hours I have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the day of grace is fled;<br />
There&rsquo;s no repentance in the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor pardon offered to the dead.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I feel all that to be very true, and I am afraid I
do not improve the hours I have, as I ought to do.&nbsp; I think 
I shall not live very long; and when I remember my sins, I 
say,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lord, at thy feet ashamed I lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upward I dare not look;<br />
Pardon my sins before I die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blot them from thy book.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you think he will pardon me, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I have great hopes that he <span 
class="smcap">has</span> pardoned <!-- page 148--><a 
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>you; that 
he has heard your prayers, and put you into the number of his 
true children already.&nbsp; You have had strong proofs of his 
mercy to your soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have, and I wish to love and bless him for 
it.&nbsp; He is good, <i>very</i> good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had for some time past occurred to my mind that a course of
<i>regulated</i> conversations on the first principles of 
religion would be very desirable from time to time, for this 
interesting child&rsquo;s sake: and I thought the Church 
Catechism would be the best groundwork for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you can repeat the 
Catechism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but I think that has been one of my sins in 
the sight of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! repeating your Catechism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, in such a way as I used to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very carelessly indeed.&nbsp; I never thought about the
meaning of the words, and that must be very wrong.&nbsp; Sir, the
Catechism is full of good things; I wish I understood them 
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my child, we will talk a little about those
good things which, as you truly say, are contained in the 
Catechism.&nbsp; Did you ever consider what it is to be a member 
of Christ, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of 
heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, sir, I have lately considered it a good deal; 
and I want to be such, not only in name, but in deed and in 
truth.&nbsp; You once told me, sir, that &lsquo;as the branch is 
to the vine, and the stone to the building, and the limb to the 
body and the head, so is a true believer to the Lord Jesus 
Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; But how am I to know that I belong to Christ
as a <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>true <i>member</i>, which, you said 
one day in the church, means the same as a <i>limb</i> of the 
body, such as a leg or an arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you love Christ now in a way you never used to do 
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he first loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that he first loved you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he sent me instruction, and made me feel the 
sin of my heart, and taught me to pray for pardon, and love his 
ways; he sent you to teach me, sir, and to show me the way to be 
saved; and now I want to be saved in that way that he 
pleases.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel as if I loved all that he has 
said and done, so much, that I wish never to think about anything
else.&nbsp; I know I did not use to feel so; and I think if he 
had not loved me first, my wicked heart would never have cared 
about him.&nbsp; I once loved anything better than religion, but 
now it is everything to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in your heart that Christ is able and 
willing to save the chief of sinners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young, but a great sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not of his mercy that you know and feel yourself 
to be a sinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; yes, it must be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you earnestly desire to forsake all sin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know myself, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel a spirit within you resisting sin, and 
making you hate it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;Who gave you that spirit?&nbsp; Were you always 
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Christ, who loved me, and gave himself for 
me.&nbsp; I was quite different once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, my dear Jane, does not all this show a 
connection between the Lord Jesus Christ and your soul?&nbsp; 
Does it not seem as if you lived, and moved, and had a spiritual 
being from him?&nbsp; Just as a limb is connected with your body,
and so with your head, and thereby gets power to live and move 
through the flowing of the blood from the one to the other; so 
are you spiritually a limb or member of Christ, if you believe in
him, and thus obtain, through faith, a power to love him, and 
live to his praise and glory.&nbsp; Do you understand 
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I believe I do; and it is very comfortable to
my thoughts to look up to Christ as a living Head, and to 
consider myself as the least and lowest of all his 
members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me what your thoughts are as to being a child 
of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, sir, I do not deserve to be called his 
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me who <i>does</i> deserve it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, then, comes any one to be a child of God, when by 
nature we are children of wrath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God&rsquo;s grace, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does grace mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Favour; free favour to sinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right; and what does God bestow upon the children of 
wrath, when he makes them children of grace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness; 
is it not, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the fruit of Christ&rsquo;s redeeming 
love; and I <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>hope <i>you</i> are a partaker of 
the blessing.&nbsp; The family of God is named after him, and he 
is the first-born of many brethren.&nbsp; What a mercy that 
Christ calls himself &lsquo;a <i>Brother</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; My 
little girl, he is <i>your</i> Brother; and will not be ashamed 
to own you, and present you to his Father at the last day, as one
that he has purchased with his blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could love my Father and my Brother which are 
in heaven better than I do.&nbsp; Lord be merciful to me a 
sinner!&nbsp; I think, sir, if I am a child of God, I am often a 
rebellious one.&nbsp; He shows kindness to me beyond others, and 
yet I make a very poor return.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Are these thy favours day by day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me above the rest?<br />
Then let me love thee more than they,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strive to serve thee best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That will be the best way to approve yourself a real 
child of God.&nbsp; Show your love and thankfulness to such a 
Father, who hath prepared for you an inheritance among the saints
in light, and made you &lsquo;an inheritor of the kingdom of 
heaven, as well as a member of Christ, and a child of 
God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Do you know what &lsquo;the kingdom of 
heaven&rsquo; means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that instant her mother entered the house below, and 
began to speak to a younger child in a passionate, scolding tone 
of voice, accompanied by some very offensive language; but 
quickly stopped on hearing us in conversation up stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my poor mother!&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;you 
would not have stopped so short, if Mr. --- had not been 
here.&nbsp; Sir, you hear how my mother swears; pray say 
something to her; she will not hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>I went towards the stair-head, and called to the woman;
but ashamed at the thought of my having probably overheard her 
expressions, she suddenly left the house, and for that time 
escaped reproof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said little Jane, &ldquo;I am so afraid, if
I go to heaven I shall never see my poor mother there.&nbsp; I 
wish I may, but she does swear so, and keep such bad 
company.&nbsp; As I lie here a-bed, sir, for hours together, 
there is often so much wickedness, and noise, and quarrelling 
down below, that I do not know how to bear it.&nbsp; It comes 
very near, sir, when one&rsquo;s father and mother go on 
so.&nbsp; I want them all to turn to the Lord, and go to 
heaven.&mdash;Tell me now, sir, something about being an 
inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may remember, my child, what I have told you when 
explaining the Catechism in the church, that the &lsquo;kingdom 
of heaven&rsquo; in the Scripture means the church of Christ upon
earth, as well as the state of glory in heaven.&nbsp; The one is 
a preparation for the other.&nbsp; All true Christians are heirs 
of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, and shall inherit the glory 
and happiness of his kingdom, and live with Christ and be with 
him for ever.&nbsp; This is the free gift of God to his adopted 
children; and all that believe aright in Christ shall experience 
the truth of that promise, &lsquo;It is your Father&rsquo;s good 
pleasure to give you the kingdom.&rsquo;&nbsp; You are a poor 
girl now, but I trust &lsquo;an entrance shall be ministered unto
you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and 
Saviour Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; You suffer now; but are you 
not willing to suffer for his sake, and to bear patiently those 
things to which he calls you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, very willing; I would not complain.&nbsp; It is
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Then, my dear, you shall reign with him.&nbsp; 
Through much tribulation you may, perhaps, enter into the kingdom
of God; but tribulation worketh patience; and patience, 
experience; and experience, hope.&nbsp; As a true &lsquo;member 
of Christ,&rsquo; show yourself to be a dutiful &lsquo;child of 
God,&rsquo; and your portion will be that of an inheritor of the 
kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Faithful is He that hath promised.&nbsp;
Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall 
bring it to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, I do so love to hear of these 
things.&nbsp; And I think, sir, I should not love them so much if
I had no part in them.&nbsp; Sir, there is one thing I want to 
ask you.&nbsp; It is a great thing, and I may be wrong&mdash;I am
so young&mdash;and yet I hope I mean right&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she hesitated and paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Do not be fearful of mentioning 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; A tear rolled down her cheek&mdash;a slight 
blush coloured her countenance.&nbsp; She lifted up her eyes to 
heaven for a moment, and then, fixing them on me with a solemn, 
affecting look, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May so young a poor child as I am be admitted to the 
Lord&rsquo;s Supper?&nbsp; I have for some time wished it, but 
dared not to mention it, for fear you should think it 
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jenny, I have no doubt respecting it, and shall
be very glad to converse with you on the subject, and hope that 
He who has given you the desire, will bless his own ordinance to 
your soul.&nbsp; Would you wish it now or to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, if you please, sir;&mdash;will you come 
to-morrow and talk to me about it? and if you think it proper, I 
shall <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>be thankful.&nbsp; I am growing 
faint now&mdash;I hope to be better when you come 
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much pleased with her proposal, and rejoiced in the 
prospect of seeing so young and sincere a Christian thus devote 
herself to the Lord, and receive the sacramental seal of a 
Saviour&rsquo;s love to her soul.</p>
<p>Disease was making rapid inroads upon her constitution, and 
she was aware of it.&nbsp; But as the outward man decayed, she 
was strengthened with might, by God&rsquo;s Spirit in the inner 
man.&nbsp; She was evidently ripening fast for a better 
world.</p>
<p>I remember these things with affectionate pleasure; they 
revive my earlier associations, and I hope the recollection does 
me good.&nbsp; I wish them to do good to thee likewise, my 
reader; and therefore I write them down.</p>
<p>May the simplicity that is in Christ render</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The short and simple annals of the 
poor&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a mean of grace and blessing to thy soul!&nbsp; Out of the 
mouth of this babe and suckling may God ordain thee 
strength!&nbsp; If thou art willing, thou mayest perchance hear 
something further respecting her.</p>
<h3>PART IV.</h3>
<p>I was so much affected with my last visit to little Jane, and 
particularly with her tender anxiety respecting the Lord&rsquo;s 
Supper, that it formed the chief subject of my thoughts for the 
remainder of the day.&nbsp; I rode in the afternoon to a 
favourite spot, where I sometimes <!-- page 155--><a 
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>indulged in
solitary meditation; where I wished to reflect on the interesting
case of my little disciple.</p>
<p>It was a place well suited for such a purpose.</p>
<p>In the widely sweeping curve of a beautiful bay, there is a 
kind of chasm or opening in one of the lofty cliffs which bound 
it.&nbsp; This produces a very romantic and striking 
effect.&nbsp; The steep descending sides of this opening in the 
cliff are covered with trees, bushes, wild flowers, fern, 
wormwood, and many other herbs, here and there contrasted with 
bold masses of rock or brown earth.</p>
<p>In the higher part of one of those declivities two or three 
picturesque cottages are fixed, and seem half suspended in the 
air.</p>
<p>From the upper extremity of this great fissure, or opening in 
the cliff, a small stream of water enters by a cascade, flows 
through the bottom, winding in a varied course of about a quarter
of a mile in length; and then runs into the sea across a smooth 
expanse of firm, hard sand, at the lower extremity of the 
chasm.&nbsp; At this point, the sides of the woody banks are very
lofty, and, to a spectator from the bottom, exhibit a mixture of 
the grand and beautiful not often exceeded.</p>
<p>Near the mouth of this opening was a little hollow recess, or 
cave in the cliff, from whence, on one hand, I could see the 
above-described romantic scene; on the other, a long train of 
perpendicular cliffs, terminating in a bold and wild-shaped 
promontory, which closed the bay at one end, while a conspicuous 
white cliff stood directly opposite, about four miles distant, at
the further point of the bay.</p>
<p>The shore, between the different cliffs and the edge of the 
waves, was in some parts covered with stones and shingle; <!-- 
page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
156</span>in some, with firm sand; and in others, with irregular 
heaps of little rocks fringed with sea-weed, and ornamented with 
small yellow shells.</p>
<p>The cliffs themselves were diversified with strata of 
various-coloured earth, black, yellow, brown, and orange.&nbsp; 
The effects of iron ore, producing very manifest changes of hue, 
were everywhere seen in trickling drops and streamlets down the 
sides.</p>
<p>The huts in which the fishermen kept their baskets, nets, 
boats, and other implements, occupied a few retired spots on the 
shore.</p>
<p>The open sea, in full magnificence, occupied the centre of the
prospect; bounded, indeed, in one small part, by a very distant 
shore, on the rising ascent from which the rays of the sun 
rendered visible a cathedral church, with its towering spire, at 
near thirty miles&rsquo; distance.&nbsp; Everywhere else the sea 
beyond was limited only by the sky.</p>
<p>A frigate was standing into the bay, not very far from my 
recess; other vessels of every size, sailing in many directions, 
varied the scene, and furnished matter for a thousand sources of 
contemplation.</p>
<p>At my feet the little rivulet, gently rippling over pebbles, 
soon mingled with the sand, and was lost in the waters of the 
mighty ocean.&nbsp; The murmuring of the waves, as the tide ebbed
or flowed, on the sand; their dashing against some more distant 
rocks, which were covered fantastically with sea-weed and shells;
sea-birds floating in the air aloft, or occasionally screaming 
from their holes in the cliffs; the hum of human voices in the 
ships and boats, borne along the water: all these sounds served 
to promote, rather than interrupt, meditation.&nbsp; They were 
soothingly blended <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>together, and entered the ear in a 
kind of natural harmony.</p>
<p>In the quiet enjoyment of a scene like this, the lover of 
nature&rsquo;s beauties will easily find scope for spiritual 
illustration.</p>
<p>Here I sat and mused over the interesting character and 
circumstances of little Jane.&nbsp; Here I prayed that God would 
effectually teach me those truths which I ought to teach her.</p>
<p>When I thought of her youth, I blushed to think how superior 
she was to what I well remember myself to have been at the same 
age; nay, how far my superior at that very time.&nbsp; I 
earnestly desired to catch something of the spirit which appeared
so lovely in her; for, simple, teachable, meek, humble yet 
earnest in her demeanour, she bore living marks of heavenly 
teaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;has called this 
little child, and set her in the midst of us, as a parable, a 
pattern, an emblem.&nbsp; And he saith, &lsquo;Verily, except ye 
be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter 
into the kingdom of heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh that I may be humble 
as this little child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was thus led into a deep self-examination, and was severely 
exercised with fear and apprehension, whether I was myself a real
partaker of those divine influences which I could so evidently 
discover in her.&nbsp; Sin appeared to me just then to be more 
than ever &ldquo;exceeding sinful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inward and inbred
corruptions made me tremble.&nbsp; The danger of self-deception 
in so great a matter alarmed me.&nbsp; I was a teacher of others;
but was I indeed spiritually taught myself?</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>A spirit of anxious inquiry ran through every thought: 
I looked at the manifold works of creation around me; I perceived
the greatest marks of regularity and order; but <i>within</i> I 
felt confusion and disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The waves of the sea,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;ebb and 
flow in exact obedience to the law of their Creator.&nbsp; Thus 
far they come, and no further&mdash;they retire again to their 
accustomed bounds; and so maintain a regulated succession of 
effects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, alas! the waves of passion and affection in the 
human breast manifest more of the wild confusion of a storm, than
the orderly regularity of a tide.&nbsp; Grace only can subdue 
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What peaceful harmony subsists throughout all this 
lovely landscape!&nbsp; These majestic cliffs, some clothed with 
trees and shrubs; others bare and unadorned with herbage, yet 
variegated with many-coloured earths; these are not only sublime 
and delightful to behold, but they are answering the end of their
creation, and serve as a barrier to stop the progress of the 
waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how little peace and harmony can I comparatively 
see in my own heart!&nbsp; The landscape <i>within</i> is marred 
by dreary, barren wilds, and wants that engaging character which 
the various parts of this prospect before me so happily 
preserve.&nbsp; Sin, sin is the bane of mortality, and heaps 
confusion upon confusion, wherever it prevails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, saith the voice of Promise, &lsquo;Sin shall not 
have dominion over you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, then, &lsquo;may I yield
myself unto God, as one that am alive from the dead, and my 
members as instruments of righteousness unto God!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
And thus may I become an able and willing minister of the New 
Testament!</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;I wish I were like this little stream of 
water.&nbsp; It takes its first rise scarcely a mile off; yet it 
has done good even in that short course.&nbsp; It has passed by 
several cottages in its way, and afforded life and health to the 
inhabitants; it has watered their little gardens as it flows, and
enriched the meadows near its banks.&nbsp; It has satisfied the 
thirst of the flocks that are feeding aloft on the hills, and 
perhaps refreshed the shepherd&rsquo;s boy who sits watching his 
master&rsquo;s sheep hard by.&nbsp; It then quietly finishes its 
current in this secluded dell, and, agreeably to the design of 
its Creator, quickly vanishes in the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May <i>my</i> course be like unto thine, thou little 
rivulet!&nbsp; Though short be my span of life, yet may I be 
useful to my fellow-sinners as I travel onwards!&nbsp; Let me be 
a dispenser of spiritual support and health to many!&nbsp; Like 
this stream, may I prove &lsquo;the poor man&rsquo;s 
friend&rsquo; by the way, and water the souls that thirst for the
river of life, wherever I meet them!&nbsp; And if it please thee,
O my God, let me in my latter end be like this brook.&nbsp; It 
calmly, though not quite silently, flows through this scene of 
peace and loveliness, just before it enters the sea.&nbsp; Let me
thus gently close my days likewise; and may I not unusefully tell
to others of the goodness and mercy of our Saviour, till I arrive
at the vast ocean of eternity!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thither,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;little Jane is fast 
hastening.&nbsp; Short, but not useless, has been <i>her</i> 
course.&nbsp; I feel the great importance of it in my own soul at
this moment.&nbsp; I view a work of mercy <i>there</i>, to which 
I do hope I am not quite a stranger in the experience of my own 
heart.&nbsp; The thought enlivens my spirit, and leads me to see 
that, great as is the power of sin the power of Jesus is greater;
and, through <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>grace, I <i>may</i> meet my dear 
young disciple, my child in the gospel, my sister in the faith, 
in a brighter, a better world hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the whole of this meditation which 
calmed and prepared my mind for my promised visit the next 
day.&nbsp; I looked forward to it with affectionate anxiety.</p>
<p>It was now time to return homewards.&nbsp; The sun was 
setting.&nbsp; The lengthened shadows of the cliffs, and of the 
hills towering again far above them, cast a brown but not 
unpleasing tint over the waters of the bay.&nbsp; Further on the 
beams of the sun still maintained their splendour.&nbsp; Some of 
the sails of the distant ships, enlivened by its rays, appeared 
like white spots in the blue horizon, and seemed to attract my 
notice, as if to claim at least the passing prayer, &ldquo;God 
speed the mariners on their voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quitted my retreat in the cliff with some reluctance; but 
with a state of mind, as I hoped, solemnized by reflection, and 
animated to fresh exertion.</p>
<p>I walked up by a steep pathway, that winded through the trees 
and shrubs on the sides of one of the precipices.&nbsp; At every 
step the extent of prospect enlarged, and acquired a new and 
varying character, by being seen through the trees on each 
side.&nbsp; Climbing up a kind of rude, inartificial set of stone
stairs in the bank, I passed by the singularly situated cottages 
which I had viewed from beneath; received and returned the 
evening salutation of the inhabitants, sitting at their doors, 
and just come home from labour; till I arrived at the top of the 
precipice, where I had left my horse tied to a gate.</p>
<p>Could <i>he</i> have enjoyed it, he had a noble prospect 
around <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>him in every direction from this 
elevated point of view, where he had been stationed while I was 
on the shore below.&nbsp; But wherein he most probably failed I 
think his rider did not.&nbsp; The landscape, taken in connection
with my recent train of thought about myself and little Jane, 
inspired devotion.</p>
<p>The sun was now set: the bright colours of the western clouds,
faintly reflected from the south-eastern hills, that were unseen 
from my retreat in the cliff, or only perceived by their evening 
shadows on the sea, now added to the beauty of the prospect on 
the south and west.&nbsp; Every element contributed to the 
interesting effect of the scenery.&nbsp; The <i>earth</i> was 
diversified in shape and ornament.&nbsp; The <i>waters</i> of the
ocean presented a noble feature in the landscape.&nbsp; The 
<i>air</i> was serene, or only ruffled by a refreshing breeze 
from the shore.&nbsp; And the sun&rsquo;s <i>fiery</i> beams, 
though departing for the night, still preserved such a portion of
light and warmth as rendered all the rest delightful to an 
evening traveller.&nbsp; From this point the abyss, occasioned by
the great fissure in the cliff, appeared grand and 
interesting.&nbsp; Trees hung over it on each side, projecting 
not only their branches, but many of their roots in wild and 
fantastic forms.&nbsp; Masses of earth had recently fallen from 
the upper to the lower parts of the precipice, carrying trees and
plants down the steep descent.&nbsp; The character of the soil 
and the unceasing influence of the stream at the bottom, seemed 
to threaten further slips of the land from the summit.&nbsp; From
hence the gentle murmur of the cascade at the head of the chine 
stole upon the ear without much interruption to the quietness of 
the scene.&nbsp; A fine rocky cliff, half buried in trees, stood 
erect on the land side about a mile distant, and <!-- page 
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
162</span>seemed to vie with those on the shore in challenging 
the passenger&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; In the distance stood a 
noble ash-tree, which, on a considerable height, majestically 
reigned as the patriarch of the grove near which it grew.&nbsp; 
Every object combined to please the eye and direct the 
traveller&rsquo;s heart to admire and love the Author and Creator
of all that is beautiful to sense and edifying to the soul.</p>
<p>The next morning I went to Jane&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; On 
entering the door, the woman, who so frequently visited her, met 
me, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, sir, you will not wake her just yet; for she 
has dropped asleep, and she seldom gets much rest, pool 
girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went gently up stairs.</p>
<p>The child was in a half-sitting posture, leaning her head upon
her right hand, with her Bible open before her.&nbsp; She had 
evidently fallen asleep while reading.&nbsp; Her countenance was 
beautifully composed and tranquil.&nbsp; A few tears had rolled 
down her cheek, and (probably unknown to her) dropped upon the 
pages of her book.</p>
<p>I looked around me for a moment.&nbsp; The room was outwardly 
comfortless and uninviting: the walls out of repair; the sloping 
roof somewhat shattered; the floor broken and uneven; no 
furniture but two tottering bedsteads, a three-legged stool, and 
an old oak chest; the window broken in many places, and mended 
with patches of paper.&nbsp; A little shelf against the wall, 
over the bedstead where Jane lay, served for her physic, her 
food, and her books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet <i>here</i>,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;lies 
an heir of glory, waiting for a happy dismissal.&nbsp; Her 
earthly home is poor, indeed; but she has a house not made with 
hands, eternal in the <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>heavens.&nbsp; She has little to 
attach her to this world; but what a weight of glory in the world
to come!&nbsp; This mean, despised chamber is a palace in the eye
of faith, for it contains one that is inheritor of a 
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I approached without waking her, and observed that she had 
been reading the twenty-third chapter of St. Luke.&nbsp; The 
finger of her left hand lay upon the book, pointing to the words,
as if she had been using it to guide her eye whilst she read.</p>
<p>I looked at the place, and was pleased at the apparently 
casual circumstance of her finger pointing at these 
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy 
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this casual or designed?&rdquo; thought I.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Either way it is remarkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in another moment I discovered that her finger was indeed 
an index to the thoughts of her heart.</p>
<p>She half awoke from her dozing state, but not sufficiently so 
to perceive that any person was present, and said in a kind of 
whisper:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, remember me&mdash;remember 
me&mdash;remember&mdash;remember a poor child&mdash;Lord, 
remember me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then suddenly started and perceived me, as she became 
fully awake.&nbsp; A faint blush overspread her cheeks for a 
moment, and then disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dame K---, how long have I been asleep?&mdash;Sir, I am
very sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am very glad to find you thus,&rdquo; I 
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may say with David, &lsquo;I laid me 
down and slept: I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What were you reading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The history of the crucifying of Jesus, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;How far had you read when you fell 
asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the prayer of the thief that was crucified with him;
and when I came to that place I stopped, and thought what a mercy
it would be if the Lord Jesus, should remember me 
likewise&mdash;and so I fell asleep; and I fancied in my dream 
that I saw Christ upon the cross; and I thought I said, 
&lsquo;Lord, remember me;&rsquo; and I am sure he did not look 
angry upon me&mdash;and then I awoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this seemed to be a sweet commentary on the text, and a 
most suitable forerunner of our intended sacramental service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear child, I am come, as you wished me, to 
administer the sacrament of the body and blood of our blessed 
Saviour to you; and I daresay neighbour K--- will be glad to join
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to me a little about it first, sir, if you 
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember what you have learned in your Catechism 
about it.&nbsp; Let us consider.&nbsp; A sacrament, you know, is 
&lsquo;an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual 
grace, given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means 
whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us 
thereof.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now the Lord has ordained bread and wine in
the holy supper, as the outward mark, which we behold with our 
eyes.&nbsp; It is a sign, a token, a seal of his love, grace, and
blessing, which he promises to, and bestows on, all who receive 
it, rightly believing on his name and work.&nbsp; He in this 
manner preserves amongst us a &lsquo;continual remembrance of his
death, and of the benefits which we receive 
thereby.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you believe respecting the death of Christ, 
Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That because he died, sir, we live.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>&ldquo;What life do we live thereby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The life of grace and mercy <i>now</i>, and the life of
glory and happiness hereafter; is it not, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, assuredly: this is the fruit of the death of 
Christ, and thus he &lsquo;opened the kingdom of heaven to all 
believers.&rsquo;&nbsp; As bread and wine strengthen and refresh 
your poor, weak, fainting body in this very sickness, so does the
blessing of his body and blood strengthen and refresh the souls 
of all that repose their faith, hope, and affections on him who 
loved us and gave himself for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears ran down her cheeks as she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a Saviour!&nbsp; Oh, what a sinner!&nbsp; How 
kind! how good!&nbsp; And is this for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not, dear child.&nbsp; He that has made you to 
love him thus, loves you too well to deny you.&nbsp; He will in 
no wise cast out any that come to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I can never think 
about Jesus and his love to sinners, without wondering how it can
be.&nbsp; I deserve nothing but his anger on account of my 
sins.&nbsp; Why then does he love me?&nbsp; My heart is 
evil.&nbsp; Why then does he love me?&nbsp; I continually forget 
all his goodness.&nbsp; Why then does he love me?&nbsp; I neither
pray to him, nor thank him, nor do anything as I ought to 
do.&nbsp; Why then such love to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How plain it is that all is mercy from first to last! 
and that sweetens the blessing, my child.&nbsp; Are you not 
willing to give Christ all the honour of your salvation, and to 
take all the blame of your sins on your own self?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir, I am.&nbsp; My hymn says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Blest be the Lord, that sent his Son<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To take our flesh and blood;<br />
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
166</span>He for our lives gave up his own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make our peace with God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He honoured all his Father&rsquo;s laws,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we have disobeyed;<br />
He bore our sins upon the cross,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our full ransom paid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you remember your hymns so well, 
Jenny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you don&rsquo;t know what pleasure they give 
me.&nbsp; I am very glad you gave me that little book of Hymns 
for Children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A severe fit of coughing interrupted her speech for a 
while.&nbsp; The woman held her head.&nbsp; It was distressing to
observe her struggle for breath, and almost, as it were, for 
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear!&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;I wish I could
help thee, and ease thy pains; but they will not last for 
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God helps me,&rdquo; said the girl, recovering her 
breath; &ldquo;God helps me&mdash;he will carry me through.&nbsp;
Sir, you look frightened.&nbsp; I am not afraid&mdash;this is 
nothing&mdash;I am better now.&nbsp; Thank you, dame, thank 
you.&nbsp; I am very troublesome; but the Lord will bless you for
this and all your kindness to me: yes, sir, and yours too.&nbsp; 
Now talk to me again about the sacrament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is required, Jenny, of them who come to the 
Lord&rsquo;s Supper?&nbsp; There are five things named in the 
Catechism; do you remember what is the first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and then said, with a solemn and intelligent 
look,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To examine themselves whether they repent them truly of
their former sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope and think that you know what this means, <!-- 
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
167</span>Jenny.&nbsp; The Lord has given you the spirit of 
repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows, sir, what the thoughts of past sin have 
been to me.&nbsp; Yes, the Lord knows, and that is enough; and I 
hope he forgives me for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; His blood 
cleanseth from all sin.&nbsp; Sir, I sometimes think of my sins 
till I tremble, and it makes me cry to think that I have offended
such a God; and then he comforts me again with sweet thoughts 
about Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well, my child&mdash;be it so.&nbsp; The next 
thing mentioned in that article of your Catechism, what is 
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steadfastly purposing to lead a new life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life, sir, will be a short one; and I wish it had 
been a better one.&nbsp; But from my heart I desire that it may 
be a <i>new</i> one for the time to come.&nbsp; I want to forsake
all my evil ways and thoughts, and evil words, and evil 
companions; and to do what God bids me, and what you tell me is 
right, sir, and what I read of in my Bible.&nbsp; But I am afraid
I do not, my heart is so full of sin.&nbsp; However, sir, I pray 
to God to help me.&nbsp; My days will be few; but I wish they may
be spent to the glory of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessing of the Lord be upon you, Jane; so that 
whether you live, you may live to the Lord; or whether you die, 
you may die unto the Lord; and that, living or dying, you may be 
the Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What is the next thing 
mentioned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have a lively faith in God&rsquo;s mercy through 
Christ, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that God is merciful to you in the 
pardon of your sins?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>&ldquo;I do, sir,&rdquo; said the child earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he pardons you, is it for your own sake, 
Jenny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, no; it is for Christ&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for my
Saviour Jesus Christ&rsquo;s sake, and that only.&nbsp; Christ is
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you trust him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I must not mistrust him; nor would I, if I 
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, child; he is worthy of all your 
trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, sir, I am to have a thankful remembrance of 
his death.&nbsp; I can never think of his dying, but I think also
what a poor unworthy creature I am; and yet he is so good to 
me.&nbsp; I wish I <i>could</i> thank him&mdash;sir, I have been 
reading about his death&mdash;how could the people do as they did
to him?&mdash;but it was all for our salvation.&nbsp; And the 
thief on the cross&mdash;that is beautiful.&nbsp; I hope he will 
remember me too, and that I shall always remember him and his 
death most thankfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lastly, Jenny, are you in charity with all 
men?&nbsp; Do you forgive all that have offended you?&nbsp; Do 
you bear ill-will in your heart to anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear sir, no! how can I?&nbsp; If God is good to me, if
he forgives me, how can I help forgiving others?&nbsp; There is 
not a person in all the world, I think, sir, that I do not wish 
well to for Christ&rsquo;s sake, and that from the bottom of my 
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel towards those bold, wanton, 
ill-tempered girls at the next door, who jeer and mock you so 
about your religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, the worst thing I wish them is, that God may give 
them grace to repent; that he may change their hearts, and pardon
all their wicked ways and words.&nbsp; May he forgive them, as I 
do with all my soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>She ceased&mdash;I wished to ask no more.&nbsp; My 
heart was full.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can this be the religion of a 
child?&rdquo; thought I.&nbsp; &ldquo;O that we were all children
like her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reach me that prayer-book, and the cup and plate.&nbsp;
My dear friends, I will now, with God&rsquo;s blessing, partake 
with you in the holy communion of our Lord&rsquo;s body and 
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time was sweet and solemn.&nbsp; I went through the 
sacramental service.</p>
<p>The countenance and manner of the child evinced powerful 
feelings.&nbsp; Tears mingled with smiles&mdash;resignation 
brightened by hope&mdash;humility animated by faith&mdash;a 
child-like modesty adorned with the understanding of a riper 
age&mdash;gratitude, peace, devotion, patience&mdash;all these 
were visible.&nbsp; I thought I distinctly saw them all&mdash;and
did <i>I</i> alone see them?&nbsp; Is it too much to say that 
other created beings, whom I could not behold with my natural 
eyes, were witnesses of the scene?</p>
<p>If ministering angels do ascend and descend with glad tidings 
between earth and heaven, I think they did so then.</p>
<p>When I had concluded the service, I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear Jane, you are indeed become a sister in 
the Church of Christ.&nbsp; May his Spirit and blessing rest upon
you, strengthen and refresh you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mercies are great, very great, sir; greater than I 
can express.&nbsp; I thank you for this favour&mdash;I thought I 
was too young&mdash;it seemed too much for me to think of; but I 
am now sure the Lord is good to me, and I hope I have done 
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jenny; and I trust you are both outwardly and <!--
page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
170</span>inwardly <i>sealed</i> by the Holy Ghost to the day of 
redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I shall never forget this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, I think, shall I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said the good old woman; &ldquo;sure the 
Lord has been in the midst of us three to-day, while we have been
gathered together in his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;I wish you could 
speak to my mother when you come again.&nbsp; But she keeps out 
of your sight.&nbsp; I am so grieved about her soul, and I am 
afraid she cares nothing at all about it herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall have an opportunity the next time I 
come.&nbsp; Farewell, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, sir; and I thank you for all your kindness to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I thought within myself as I left the 
cottage, &ldquo;this young bud of grace will bloom beauteously in
paradise!&nbsp; The Lord transplant her thither in his own good 
time.&nbsp; Yet, if it be his will, may she live a little longer,
that I may further profit by her conversation and 
example!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly, some who peruse these simple records of poor little 
Jane may wish the same.&nbsp; If it be so, we will visit her 
again before she departs hence and is no more seen.</p>
<h3>PART V.</h3>
<p>Jane was hastening fast to her dissolution.&nbsp; She still, 
however, preserved sufficient strength to converse with much 
satisfaction to herself and those who visited her.&nbsp; Such as 
<!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
171</span>could truly estimate the value of her spiritual state 
of mind were but few; yet the most careless could not help being 
struck with her affectionate seriousness, her knowledge of the 
Scriptures, and her happy application of them to her own 
case.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The holy spark divine,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which regenerating grace had implanted in her life, had 
kindled a flame which warmed and animated the beholder.&nbsp; To 
<i>some</i>, I am persuaded, her example and conversation were 
made a blessing.&nbsp; Memory reflects with gratitude, whilst I 
write, on the profit and consolation which I individually derived
from her society.&nbsp; Nor I alone.&nbsp; The last day will, if 
I err not, disclose further fruits, resulting from the love of 
God to this little child, and, through her, to others that saw 
her.&nbsp; And may not hope indulge the prospect, that this 
simple memorial of her history shall be as one arrow drawn from 
the quiver of the Almighty to reach the hearts of the young and 
the thoughtless?&nbsp; Direct its course, O my God!&nbsp; May the
eye that reads, and the ear that hears, the record of little 
Jane, through the power of the Spirit of the Most High, each 
become the witness for the truth as it is in Jesus!</p>
<p>I remembered the tender solicitude of this dear child for her 
mother.&nbsp; I well knew what an awful contrast the dispositions
and conduct of her parents exhibited, when compared with her 
own.</p>
<p>I resolved to avail myself of the first opportunity I could 
seize to speak to the mother in the child&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp;
The woman had latterly avoided me, conscious of deserving, and 
fearful of receiving reproof.&nbsp; The road by which I usually 
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
172</span>approached the house lay, for some little distance, 
sufficiently in sight of its windows to enable the woman to 
retire out of the way before I arrived.&nbsp; There was, however,
another path, through fields at the back of the village, which, 
owing to the situation of the ground, allowed of an approach 
unperceived, till a visitor reached the very cottage itself.</p>
<p>One morning, soon after the sacramental interview related in 
my last paper, I chose <i>this</i> road for my visit.&nbsp; It 
was preferable to me on every account.&nbsp; The distance was not
quite half a mile from my house.&nbsp; The path was 
retired.&nbsp; I hereby avoided the noise and interruption which 
even a village street will sometimes present, to disturb the 
calmness of interesting meditation.</p>
<p>As I passed through the churchyard, and cast my eye on the 
memorable epitaph, &ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; I thought within me, 
&ldquo;will my poor little Jane mingle her mouldering remains 
with this dust, and sleep with her fathers!&nbsp; Soon will the 
youthful tongue, which now lisps hosannas to the Son of David, 
and delights my heart with evidences of early piety and grace, be
silent in the earth!&nbsp; Soon shall I be called to commit her 
&lsquo;body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust 
to dust.&rsquo;&nbsp; But oh, what a glorious change!&nbsp; Her 
spirit shall have then returned to God who gave it.&nbsp; Her 
soul will be joining the halleluiahs of paradise, while we sing 
her requiem at the grave.&nbsp; And her very dust shall here 
wait, in sure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection from the 
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went through the fields without meeting a single 
individual.&nbsp; I enjoyed the retirement of my solitary 
walk.&nbsp; Various surrounding objects contributed to excite 
useful <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>meditation connected with the great 
subjects of time and eternity.&nbsp; Here and there a drooping 
flower reminded me of the fleeting nature of mortal life.&nbsp; 
Sometimes a shady spot taught me to look to Him who is a 
&ldquo;shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a place of 
refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
If a worm crept across my path, I saw an emblem of myself as I am
<i>now</i>; and the winged insects, fluttering in the sunbeams, 
led me comparatively to reflect on what I hoped to be 
<i>hereafter</i>.</p>
<p>The capacious mansion of a rich neighbour appeared on the 
right hand as I walked; on my left were the cottages of the 
poor.&nbsp; The church spire pointing to heaven a little beyond, 
seemed to say to both the rich and the poor, &ldquo;Set your 
affection on things above, not on things on the 
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these objects afforded me useful 
meditation; and all obtained an increased value as such, because 
they lay in my road to the house of little Jane.</p>
<p>I was now arrived at the stile nearly adjoining her 
dwelling.&nbsp; The upper window was open, and I soon 
distinguished the sound of voices&mdash;I was glad to hear that 
of the mother.&nbsp; I entered the house door unperceived by 
those above stairs, and sat down below, not wishing as yet to 
interrupt a conversation which quickly caught my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! mother!&nbsp; I have not long to live.&nbsp; My
time will be very short.&nbsp; But I must, indeed I must, say 
something for your sake, before I die.&nbsp; O mother! you have a
soul&mdash;you have a soul; and what will become of it when you 
die?&nbsp; O my mother!&nbsp; I am so uneasy about your 
soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; I shall lose my child&mdash;she will 
die&mdash;and what shall I do when you are gone, my 
Jenny?&rdquo;&nbsp; She sobbed aloud.</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;Mother, think about your soul.&nbsp; Have you 
not neglected that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been a wicked creature, and hated all that 
was good.&nbsp; What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, you must pray to God to pardon you for 
Christ&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; You must pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny, my child, I cannot pray: I never did pray in all
my life.&nbsp; I am too wicked to pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, I have been wanting to speak to you a long 
time; but I was afraid to do it.&nbsp; You did not like me to say
anything about religion, and I did not know how to begin.&nbsp; 
But indeed, mother, I must speak now, or it may be too 
late.&nbsp; I wish Mr. --- was here, for he could talk to you 
better than I can.&nbsp; But perhaps you will think of what I 
say, poor as it is, when I am dead.&nbsp; I am but a young child,
and not fit to speak about such things to anybody.&nbsp; But, 
mother, you belong to me, and I cannot bear to think of your 
perishing for ever.&nbsp; My Lord and Saviour has shown me my own
sin and corruptions: he loved me, and gave himself for me: he 
died, and he rose again: I want to praise him for it for ever and
ever.&nbsp; I hope I shall see him in heaven; but I want to see 
you there too, mother.&nbsp; Do, pray do, leave off swearing, and
other bad ways: go to church, and hear our minister speak about 
Jesus Christ, and what he has done for wicked sinners.&nbsp; He 
wishes well to souls.&nbsp; He taught me the way, and he will 
teach you, mother.&nbsp; Why did you always go out of the house 
when he was coming?&nbsp; Do not be angry with me, mother; I only
speak for your good.&nbsp; I was once as careless as you are 
about the things of God.&nbsp; But I have seen my error.&nbsp; I 
was in the broad road leading to destruction, like many <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
175</span>other children in the parish; and the Lord saw me, and 
had mercy upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child, you were always a good girl, and minded 
your book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother, no; not always.&nbsp; I cared nothing about
goodness, nor my Bible, till the minister came and sent for us, 
as you know, on Saturday afternoons.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you 
remember, mother, that at first you did not like me to go, and 
said you would have no such <i>godly</i>, <i>pious</i> doings 
about <i>your</i> house; and that I had better play about the 
streets and fields, than be laughed at and be made game of for 
pretending to be so good?&nbsp; Ah, mother, you did not know what
I went for, and what God designed for me and my poor sinful 
soul!&nbsp; But, thank God, I did go, and there learned the way 
of salvation.&nbsp; Mother, I wish you had learned 
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I listened to this affecting conversation, it appeared to 
me, from the tone and manner of the mother&rsquo;s voice, that 
she was more under the influence of temporary grief, on account 
of her child&rsquo;s extreme illness, than sincere sorrow from 
any real sense of her sins.&nbsp; I however hoped the best, and 
rejoiced to hear such weighty and important exhortation dropping 
from her daughter&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; I felt that present 
circumstances rendered it far more valuable than my own could 
have been.</p>
<p>I have often, since that time, seen the wicked and careless 
much affected, while sitting by the dying bed of a near relative:
I have witnessed their temporary acknowledgments of sin, and 
heard their professions of amendment.&nbsp; But, after a short 
season, all has passed away like the morning dew.&nbsp; The 
friend has been buried out of sight.&nbsp; The world <!-- page 
176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
176</span>and its cares, the flesh and its sins, have returned 
with new temptations, and the eloquence of iniquity has prevailed
over the voice of truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dog has returned to his
vomit, and the sow to her wallowing in the mire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, how frequently have the deathbeds of true 
believers been blessed to the eye-witness of the triumphs of 
grace over sin, death, and hell!&nbsp; Often has the careless 
bystander received the first saving impression of divine truth, 
whilst the dying Christian has experienced and testified the 
supports of love and mercy in the trying hour.&nbsp; At such 
seasons, faith wields a bright and burning torch, which 
occasionally softens the hardest and warms the coldest 
heart.&nbsp; The expressions of that heavenly consolation and 
devout solicitude, which the Holy Spirit vouchsafes to some, thus
become the happy means of grace and blessing for the conversion 
and edification of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
unto the churches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the house-door opened, and a younger child, a 
brother of Jane&rsquo;s, came in.&nbsp; The mother asked from 
above who it was: the boy replied; and, without further inquiry, 
she remained in the chamber.&nbsp; I beckoned to the lad to sit 
down quietly; and thus it still remained unknown that I was 
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; continued Jane, &ldquo;that is my 
brother, and will soon be your only remaining child.&nbsp; Do, 
pray, encourage him to follow good ways.&nbsp; Send him to Mr. 
---, and he will be kind to him, as he has been to me.&nbsp; He 
is a wild boy, but I hope he will be brought to think about his 
soul in time.&nbsp; Those naughty, wicked boys teach him to swear
<!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
177</span>and fight, and run after all manner of evil.&nbsp; 
Lord, help him to flee from the wrath to come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made a sign to the boy to listen to what his sister said 
concerning him.&nbsp; He seemed to hear with attention, and a 
tear dropped down his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Jenny, it is to be hoped he will, and that we shall
all likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, then you must flee to Christ.&nbsp; Nothing you
can do will save you without that.&nbsp; You must repent and turn
from sin: without the grace of God you cannot do it; but seek, 
and you shall find it.&nbsp; Do, for your own sake, and for my 
sake, and my little brother&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman wept and sobbed without replying.&nbsp; I now 
thought it time to appear, went to the bottom of the stairs, and 
said, &ldquo;May a friend come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on me!&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;there is 
Mr. ---&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, sir,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;I am very glad 
you are come <i>now</i>.&nbsp; Mother, set a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked confused.&nbsp; Jane smiled as I entered, and
welcomed me as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall be forgiven, both by mother and 
daughter, for having remained so long below stairs, during the 
conversation which has just taken place.&nbsp; I came in the hope
of finding you together, as I have had a wish for some time past 
to speak to you, Sarah, on the same subjects about which, I am 
happy to say, your daughter is so anxious.&nbsp; You have long 
neglected these things, and I wished to warn you of the danger of
your state; but Jenny has said all I could desire, and I now 
solemnly ask you, whether you are not much affected by your poor 
child&rsquo;s faithful conversation?&nbsp; You ought to have been
<i>her</i> teacher and <!-- page 178--><a 
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>instructor 
in the ways of righteousness, whereas she has now become 
<i>yours</i>.&nbsp; Happy, however, will it be for you if you are
wise, and consider your latter end, and the things which belong 
to your peace, before they are hidden from your eyes!&nbsp; Look 
at your dying child, and think of your other and only remaining 
one, and say whether this sight does not call aloud upon you to 
hear and fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes were filled with tears whilst I spoke.&nbsp;
The woman hung her head down, but betrayed some emotions of 
dislike at the plain dealing used towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, Jenny,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how are you 
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I have been talking a good deal, and feel rather 
faint and weary, but my mind has been very easy and happy since I
last saw you.&nbsp; I am quite willing to die, when the Lord sees
fit.&nbsp; I have no wish to live except it be to see my friends 
in a better way before I depart.&nbsp; Sir, I used to be afraid 
to speak to them; but I feel to-day as if I could hold my peace 
no longer, and I must tell them what the Lord has done for my 
soul, and what I feel for theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a firmness, I may say a dignity with which this was 
uttered that surprised me.&nbsp; The character of the child 
seemed to be lost in that of the Christian; her natural timidity 
yielded to a holy assurance of manner resulting from her own 
inward consolations, mingled with spiritual desire for her 
mother&rsquo;s welfare.&nbsp; This produced a flush upon her 
otherwise pallid countenance, which in no small degree added to 
her interesting appearance.&nbsp; The Bible lay open before her 
as she sat up in the bed.&nbsp; With her right hand she enclosed 
her mother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, this book <i>you</i> cannot read; you should 
therefore <!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>go constantly to church, that you 
may hear it explained.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s book, and tells us
the way to heaven; I hope you will learn and mind it; with 
God&rsquo;s blessing it may save your soul.&nbsp; Do think of 
that, mother, pray do.&nbsp; I am soon going to die.&nbsp; Give 
this Bible to my brother; and will you be so kind, sir, as to 
instruct him?&nbsp; Mother, remember what I say, and this 
gentleman is witness: there is no salvation for sinners like you 
and me but in the blood of Christ; he is able to save to the 
uttermost; he will save all that come to him; he waits to be 
gracious: cast yourself upon his mercy.&nbsp; I wish&mdash;I 
wish&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was quite overcome, and sank away in a kind of fainting 
fit.</p>
<p>Her mother observed, that she would now probably remain 
insensible for some time before she recovered.</p>
<p>I improved this interval in a serious address to the woman, 
and then prepared to take my departure, perceiving that Jane was 
too much exhausted for further conversation at that time.</p>
<p>As I was leaving the room, the child said faintly, &ldquo;Come
again soon, sir; my time is very short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned home by the same retired road which I had before 
chosen.&nbsp; I silently meditated on the eminent proofs of piety
and faith which were just afforded me in the scene I had 
witnessed.</p>
<p>Surely, I thought, this is an extraordinary child!&nbsp; What 
cannot grace accomplish?&nbsp; Is it possible to doubt after 
this, <i>who</i> is the alone Author and Finisher of salvation; 
or from <i>whom</i> cometh every good and perfect gift?&nbsp; How
rich and free is the mercy of Jehovah!&nbsp; Hath not he 
&ldquo;chosen the weak things of this world to confound the 
things which <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>are mighty?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let no 
flesh glory in his presence: but &ldquo;he that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>PART VI.</h3>
<p>The truth and excellence of the religion of Jesus Christ 
appear to be remarkably established by the union of similarity 
with variety, in the effect which it produces on the hearts and 
lives of true believers.&nbsp; In the grand and essential 
features of Christian experience, the whole household of God 
possess an universal sameness of character, a family likeness, 
which distinguishes them from all the world besides: yet, in 
numerous particulars, there also exists a beautiful variety.</p>
<p>On the one hand, in the aged and the young, in the wise and 
the unlearned, in the rich and the poor; in those of stronger and
weaker degrees of mental capacity, in more sanguine or more 
sedate dispositions; and in a multitude of otherwise varying 
circumstances, there is a striking conformity of principles and 
feeling to Christ, and to each other.&nbsp; Like the flowers of 
the field and the garden, they are &ldquo;all rooted and 
grounded&rdquo; in the soil of the same earth; they are warmed by
the same sun, refreshed by the same air, and watered by the same 
dews.&nbsp; They each derive nourishment, growth, and increase 
from the same life-giving Source.&nbsp; As the flower puts forth 
its leaves and petals, adorns the place which it inhabits with 
its beauty, and possesses an internal system of qualities, 
whereby it is enabled to bring forth its seed or fruit in the 
appointed season; so does the Christian.</p>
<p><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>But, on the other hand, like the flowers also, some 
Christians may be said to grow on the mountain tops, some in 
valleys, some in the waters, and others in dry ground.&nbsp; 
Different colours, forms, and sizes, distinguish them from each 
other, and produce a diversity of character and appearance which 
affords a delightful variety, both for the purposes of use and 
beauty.&nbsp; Yet is that variety perfectly consistent with their
essential unity of nature in the vegetable kingdom, to which they
all equally belong.</p>
<p>In another particular they likewise resemble.&nbsp; They both 
die a natural death.&nbsp; The Lord ever preserves &ldquo;a seed 
to serve him,&rdquo; from generation to generation; for as one 
disappears, another springs up to supply his place.&nbsp; But 
&ldquo;it is appointed unto all men once to die.&rdquo;&mdash;Man
&ldquo;cometh forth like a flower and is cut down: he fleeth also
as a shadow, and continueth not.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;All flesh is
as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the 
grass.&nbsp; The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth 
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of such diversity of Christian characters there 
is much to love and admire.&nbsp; I have selected the case of 
little Jane, as one not undeserving of notice.</p>
<p>It is true, she was only a child&mdash;a very poor 
child&mdash;but a child saved by divine grace, enlightened with 
the purest knowledge, and adorned with unaffected holiness; she 
was a child, humble, meek, and lowly.&nbsp; She &ldquo;found 
grace in the eyes of the Lord&rdquo; while she was on earth; and,
I doubt not, will be seen on his right hand at the last 
day.&nbsp; As such, there is preciousness in the character, which
will account for my attempting once more to write concerning her,
and describe her last moments before she went to her final 
rest.</p>
<p><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>At a very early hour on the morning of the following 
day, I was awoke by the arrival of a messenger, bringing an 
earnest request that I would immediately go to the child, as her 
end appeared to be just approaching.</p>
<p>It was not yet day when I left my house to obey the 
summons.&nbsp; The morning star shone conspicuously clear.&nbsp; 
The moon cast a mild light over the prospect, but gradually 
diminished in brightness as the eastern sky became 
enlightened.&nbsp; The birds were beginning their songs, and 
seemed ready to welcome the sun&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; The dew 
plentifully covered the fields, and hung suspended in drops from 
the trees and hedges.&nbsp; A few early labourers appeared in the
lanes, travelling towards the scene of their daily 
occupations.</p>
<p>All besides was still and calm.&nbsp; My mind, as I proceeded,
was deeply exercised by thoughts concerning the affecting event 
which I expected soon to witness.</p>
<p>The rays of the morning star were not so beautiful in my 
sight, as the spiritual lustre of this young Christian&rsquo;s 
character.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her night was far spent;&rdquo; the 
morning of a &ldquo;better day was at hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sun 
of eternal blessedness was ready to break upon her soul with 
rising glory.&nbsp; Like the moon, which I saw above me, this 
child&rsquo;s exemplary deportment had gently cast a useful light
over the neighbourhood where she dwelt.&nbsp; Like this moon she 
had for a season been permitted to shine amidst the surrounding 
darkness; and her rays were also reflected from a luminary, in 
whose native splendour her own would quickly be blended and 
lost.</p>
<p>The air was cool, but the breezes of the morning were 
refreshing, and seemed to foretell the approach of a beautiful 
<!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
183</span>day.&nbsp; Being accustomed, in my walks, to look for 
subjects of improving thought and association, I found them in 
every direction around me as I hastened onwards to the house 
where Jane lay, waiting for a dismissal from her earthly 
dwelling.</p>
<p>I felt that the twilight gravity of nature was, at that hour, 
peculiarly appropriate to the circumstances of the case; and the 
more so, because that twilight was significantly adorned with the
brilliant sparklings of the star on one hand, and the clear, pale
lustre of the waning moon on the other.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the house, I found no one below; I paused 
for a few minutes, and heard the girl&rsquo;s voice very faintly 
saying, &ldquo;Do you think he will come?&nbsp; I should be so 
glad&mdash;so very glad to see him before I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ascended the stairs&mdash;her father, mother, and brother, 
together with the elderly woman before spoken of, were in the 
chamber.&nbsp; Jane&rsquo;s countenance bore the marks of speedy 
dissolution.&nbsp; Yet, although death was manifest in the 
languid features, there was something more than ever interesting 
in the whole of her external aspect.&nbsp; The moment she saw me,
a renewed vigour beamed in her eye; grateful affection sparkled 
in the dying face.</p>
<p>Although she had spoken just before I entered, yet for some 
time afterwards she was silent, but never took her eyes off 
me.&nbsp; There was animation in her look&mdash;there was 
more&mdash;something like a foretaste of heaven seemed to be 
felt, and gave an inexpressible character of spiritual beauty, 
even in death.</p>
<p>At length she said, &ldquo;This is very kind, sir&mdash;I am 
going fast&mdash;I was afraid I should never see you again in 
this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>I said, &ldquo;My child, are you resigned to 
die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted up her finger, pointed to heaven, and then directed
the same downward to her own heart, saying successively as she 
did so, &ldquo;Christ <i>there</i>, and Christ 
<i>here</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, accompanied by the action, spoke her meaning more
solemnly than can easily be conceived.</p>
<p>A momentary spasm took place.&nbsp; Looking towards her 
weeping mother, she said, &ldquo;I am very cold&mdash;but it is 
no matter&mdash;it will soon be over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for about a minute, and, on opening them 
again, said, &ldquo;I wish, sir, when I am gone, you would tell 
the other children of the parish how good the Lord has been to 
me, a poor sinner&mdash;tell them, that they who seek him early 
will find him&mdash;tell them, that the ways of sin and ignorance
are the ways to ruin and hell&mdash;and pray tell them, sir, from
me, that Christ is indeed the Way, the Truth, and the 
Life&mdash;he will in no wise cast out any that come.&nbsp; Tell 
them that I, a poor girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was quite exhausted, and sunk for a while into a torpid 
state, from which, however, she recovered gradually, uttering 
these expressions: &ldquo;Where am I?&mdash;I thought I was 
going&mdash;Lord, save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, you will soon be for ever in <i>His</i> 
arms who is now guiding you by his rod and staff through the 
valley of the shadow of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, indeed I do,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I 
long to be with him!&mdash;Oh, how good, how great, how 
merciful!&mdash;Jesus, save me, help me through this last 
trial!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then gave one hand to her father, the other to her <!-- 
page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
185</span>mother, and said, &ldquo;God bless you, God bless 
you&mdash;seek the Lord&mdash;think of me when I am gone&mdash;it
may be for your good&mdash;remember your souls&mdash;oh, for 
Christ&rsquo;s sake remember your souls&mdash;then all may be 
well&mdash;you cannot know what I have felt for both of 
you&mdash;Lord, pardon and save my dear father and 
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then took hold of her brother&rsquo;s hand, saying, 
&ldquo;Thomas, I beg you to leave off your bad ways&mdash;read 
the Bible&mdash;I give you mine&mdash;I have found it a precious 
book.&nbsp; Do you not remember our little brother, who died some
years since?&mdash;he was praying to the last moment of his 
life.&nbsp; Learn to pray while you are in health, and you will 
find the comfort and power of it when you come to die; but, first
of all, pray for a new heart&mdash;without it you will never see 
God in heaven&mdash;your present ways lead to misery and 
ruin&mdash;may the Lord turn your heart to love and follow 
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the other woman she said, &ldquo;I thank you, Dame K---, 
for all your kindness since I have been ill&mdash;you have been a
Christian friend to me, and I hope that the Lord will remember 
you for it, according to his rich mercy:&mdash;you and I have 
many a time talked together about death; and though I am the 
youngest, he calls me first to pass through it: but, blessed be 
his name, I am not terrified.&nbsp; I once thought I could never 
die without fear; but indeed I feel quite happy, now it is come; 
and so will you, if you trust him&mdash;he is the God both of the
old and the young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my child!&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;I wish I 
was as fit to die as you are; but I fear that will never 
be&mdash;my sins have been many, very many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s blood cleanseth from all sin,&rdquo; 
said the child.</p>
<p>At this moment, instead of growing weaker, through the <!-- 
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
186</span>fatigue of so much speaking, she seemed to gather fresh
strength.&nbsp; She turned to me with a look of surprising 
earnestness and animation, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, sir, have been my best friend on earth&mdash;you 
have taught me the way to heaven, and I love and thank you for 
it&mdash;you have borne with my weakness and my 
ignorance&mdash;you have spoken to me of the love of Christ, and 
he has made me to feel it in my heart&mdash;I shall see him face 
to face&mdash;he will never leave me nor forsake me&mdash;he is 
the same, and changes not.&nbsp; Dear sir, God bless 
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child suddenly rose up, with an unexpected exertion, threw
her livid, wasted arms around me, as I sat on the bedside, laid 
her head on my shoulder, and said distinctly, &ldquo;God bless 
and reward you&mdash;give thanks for me to him&mdash;my soul is 
saved&mdash;Christ is everything to me!&nbsp; Sir, we shall meet 
in heaven, shall we not?&mdash;Oh yes, yes&mdash;then all will be
peace&mdash;peace&mdash;peace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank back on the bed, and spoke no more&mdash;fetched a 
deep sigh&mdash;smiled&mdash;and died.</p>
<p>At this affecting moment, the rays of the morning sun darted 
into the room, and filled my imagination with the significant 
emblem of &ldquo;the tender mercy of our God; whereby the 
dayspring from on high hath visited us, to give light to them 
that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our 
feet into the way of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a beam of light that seemed at once to describe the 
glorious change which her soul had now already experienced; and, 
at the same time, to shed the promised consolations of hope over 
the minds of those who witnessed her departure.</p>
<p>This was an incident obviously arising from a natural <!-- 
page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
187</span>cause; but one which irresistibly connected itself with
the spiritual circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>For some time I remained silently gazing on the breathless 
corpse, and could hardly persuade myself that Jane was indeed no 
longer there.</p>
<p>As I returned homeward, I found it difficult to repress the 
strong feelings of affection which such a scene had 
excited.&nbsp; Neither did I wish it.&nbsp; Religion, reason, and
experience, rather bid us indulge, in due place and season, those
tender emotions, which keep the heart alive to its most valuable 
sensibilities.&nbsp; To check them serves but to harden the mind,
and close the avenues which lead to the sources of our best 
principles of action.</p>
<p>Jesus himself <i>wept</i> over the foreseen sorrows of 
Jerusalem.&nbsp; He <i>wept</i> also at the grave of his friend 
Lazarus.&nbsp; Such an example consecrates the tear of affection,
while it teaches us, concerning them which are asleep, not to 
sorrow, as those which have no hope.</p>
<p>I soon fell into meditation on the mysterious subject of the 
flight of a soul from this world to that of departed spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swifter than an arrow from the bow, or than the rays of
light from the sun, has this child&rsquo;s spirit hastened, in 
obedience to its summons from God, to appear in his immediate 
presence.&nbsp; How solemn a truth is this for universal 
consideration!&nbsp; But, &lsquo;washed in the blood of the Lamb 
that was slain,&rsquo; and happily made partaker of its purifying
efficacy, she meets her welcome at the throne of God.&nbsp; She 
has nothing to fear from the frowns of divine justice.&nbsp; Sin,
death, and hell, are all vanquished through the power of Him who 
hath made her more than conqueror.&nbsp; He will himself present 
her to his Father, as one of the purchased <!-- page 188--><a 
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>lambs of 
his flock&mdash;as one whom the Spirit of God &lsquo;has sealed 
unto the day of redemption.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a change for her!&mdash;from that poor tattered 
chamber to the regions of paradise!&mdash;from a bed of straw to 
the bosom of Abraham!&mdash;from poverty, sickness, and pain, to 
eternal riches, health, and joy!&mdash;from the condition of a 
decayed, weary pilgrim in this valley of tears, to that of a 
happy traveller safely arrived at home, in the rest that 
remaineth to the people of God!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost a young disciple, endeared to me by a truly
parental tie.&nbsp; Yet how can I complain of that as lost which 
God has found?&nbsp; Her willing and welcome voice no longer 
seeks or imparts instruction here.&nbsp; But it is far better 
employed.&nbsp; The angels, who rejoiced over her when her soul 
first turned to God, who watched the progress of her short 
pilgrimage, and who have now carried her triumphantly to the 
heavenly hills, have already taught her to join</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In holy song, their own immortal 
strains.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why then should I mourn?&nbsp; The whole prospect, as it 
concerns her, is filled with joy and immortality: &lsquo;Death is
swallowed up in victory.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I looked upon the dewdrops which rested on the grass and 
hung from the branches of the trees, I observed that the 
sun&rsquo;s rays first filled them with beautiful and varied 
colours; then dried them up, and they were seen no longer.</p>
<p>Thus it was with myself.&nbsp; The tears which I neither would
nor could restrain, when I first began thus to reflect on the 
image of the dying chamber of little Jane, were speedily 
brightened by the vivid sunshine of hope and confidence.&nbsp; 
They then gradually yielded to the influence of <!-- page 
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
189</span>that divine principle which shall finally wipe the tear
from every eye, and banish all sorrow and sighing for 
evermore.</p>
<p>On the fourth day from thence, Jane was buried.&nbsp; I had 
never before committed a parishioner to the ground with similar 
affections.&nbsp; The attendants were not many, but I was glad to
perceive among them some of the children who had been accustomed 
to receive my weekly private instruction along with her.</p>
<p>I wished that the scene might usefully impress their young 
hearts, and that God would bless it to their edification.</p>
<p>As I stood at the head of the grave, during the service, I 
connected past events, which had occurred in the churchyard, with
the present.&nbsp; In this spot Jane first learned the value of 
that gospel which saved her soul.&nbsp; Not many yards from her 
own burial-place, was the epitaph which has already been 
described as the first means of affecting her mind with serious 
and solemn conviction.&nbsp; It seemed to stand at <i>this</i> 
moment as a peculiar witness for those truths which its lines 
proclaimed to every passing reader.&nbsp; Such an association of 
objects produced a powerful effect on my thoughts.</p>
<p>The evening was serene&mdash;nothing occurred to interrupt the
quiet solemnity of the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace&rdquo; was the last word little Jane uttered 
while living; and peace seemed to be inscribed on the farewell 
scene of the grave where she was laid.&nbsp; A grateful 
remembrance of that peace revives in my own mind, as I write 
these memorials of it; and oh, may that peace which passeth all 
understanding be in its most perfect exercise, when I shall meet 
her again at the last day!</p>
<p>Attachment to the spot where this young Christian lay, <!-- 
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
190</span>induced me to plant a yew-tree close by the head of her
grave, adjoining the eastern wall of the church.&nbsp; I designed
it as an evergreen monument of one who was dear to memory.&nbsp; 
The young plant appeared healthy for a while, and promised by its
outward vigour long to retain its station.&nbsp; But it withered 
soon afterwards, and, like the child whose grave it pointed out 
to notice, early faded away and died.</p>
<p>The yew-tree proved a frail and short-lived monument.&nbsp; 
But a more lasting one dwells in my own heart.&nbsp; And perhaps 
this narrative may be permitted to transmit her memory to other 
generations, when the hand and heart of the writer shall be cold 
in the dust.</p>
<p>Perchance some, into whose hands these pages may fall, will be
led to cultivate their spiritual young plants with increased 
hopes of success, in so arduous an endeavour.&nbsp; May the 
tender blossoms reward their care, and bring forth early and 
acceptable fruit!</p>
<p>Some, who have perhaps been accustomed to undervalue the 
character of <i>very</i> youthful religion, may hereby see that 
the Lord of grace and glory is not limited in the exercise of his
power by age or circumstance.&nbsp; It sometimes appears in the 
displays of God&rsquo;s love to sinners, as it does in the 
manifestations of his works in the heavens, that the <i>least</i>
of the planets moves in the nearest course to the sun; and there 
enjoys the most powerful influence of his light, heat, and 
attraction.</p>
<p>The story of this Young Cottager involves a clear evidence of 
the freeness of the operations of divine grace on the heart of 
man; of the inseparable connection between true faith and 
holiness of disposition; and of the simplicity of character which
a real love of Christ transfuses into the soul.</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>How many of the household of faith of every age,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Alike unknown to fortune and to 
fame,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>have journeyed and are now travelling to their &ldquo;city of 
habitation,&rdquo; through the paths of modest obscurity and 
almost unheeded piety!&nbsp; It is one of the most interesting 
employments of the Christian minister to search out these 
spiritual lilies of the valley, whose beauty and fragrance are 
nearly concealed in their shady retreats.&nbsp; To rear the 
flower, to assist in unfolding its excellences, and bring forth 
its fruit in due season, is a work that delightfully recompenses 
the toil of the cultivator.</p>
<p>While he is occupied in this grateful task of labouring in his
heavenly Master&rsquo;s garden, some blight, some tempest, may 
chance to take away a favourite young blossom in a premature 
stage of its growth.</p>
<p>If such a case should befall him, he will then, perhaps, as I 
have often done, when standing in pensive recollection at little 
Jane&rsquo;s grave, make an application of these lines, which are
inscribed on a grave-stone erected in the same churchyard, and 
say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This lovely bud so young and fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Called hence by early doom,<br />
Just came to show how sweet a flower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In paradise would bloom.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>THE COTTAGE CONVERSATION</h2>
<p>As I journeyed late on a summer evening, meditating on the 
beauties of the prospect around me, while they gradually faded 
from my sight, through the approach of darkness, it grew suddenly
quite gloomy, and a black cloud hanging over my head threatened a
heavy shower of rain.&nbsp; The big drops began to fall, and an 
open shed, adjoining to a labourer&rsquo;s cottage, offering me a
seasonable shelter, I dismounted from my horse, and found it 
large enough to protect him as well as myself.</p>
<p>The circumstance reminded me of the happy privilege of the 
believing sinner, who finds a &ldquo;refuge from the storm, and 
the blast of the terrible ones, in the love of his 
Redeemer,&rdquo; which prepares him &ldquo;a covert from storm 
and from rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went in unperceived: the door of 
the cottage was half open, and I heard the voices of a poor man, 
his wife, and some children within.</p>
<p>I was hesitating whether to go into the house and make myself 
known, or to enjoy in solitude a meditation on the foregoing 
comparison, which my situation had <!-- page 193--><a 
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>brought to 
my mind, when these words, spoken in a calm and affectionate 
tone, struck me with mingled pleasure and surprise, and 
determined me not to interrupt the conversation:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, wife, you are in the wrong.&nbsp; Riches would 
never make us happier, so long as the Lord sees it good that we 
should be poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the wife, &ldquo;I can see no harm
in wishing for more money and better living than we have at 
present.&nbsp; Other people have risen in the world; and why 
should not we?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s neighbour Sharp has done well 
for his family, and, for anything I can see, will be one of the 
richest farmers in the parish, if he lives; and everybody knows 
he was once as poor as we are: while you and I are labouring and 
toiling from morning to night, and can but just get enough to 
fill our children&rsquo;s mouths, and keep ourselves coarsely 
clothed, and hardly that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;having food and 
raiment, let us therewith be content.&nbsp; And if it please God 
that even these things should fall short, let us submit ourselves
to God in patience and well-doing, for he gives us more than we 
deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now you are got to preaching again,&rdquo; said 
the woman; &ldquo;you never give me an answer, but you must 
always go to your Bible to help you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where can I go so well?&rdquo; replied the 
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not God&rsquo;s own word for our 
instruction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that may be, but I don&rsquo;t like so much of 
it,&rdquo; answered she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I do not like so little of it as I see and hear 
from you,&rdquo; returned the man.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;Why, that book has taught me that it is an 
honour and comfort to be a poor man, and, by the blessing of the 
Spirit of God, I believe and feel it to be true.&nbsp; I have, 
through mercy, always been enabled to get the bread of honest 
industry, and so have you; and though our children feed upon 
brown bread, and we cannot afford to buy them fine clothes, like 
some of our vain neighbours, to pamper their pride with; yet, 
bless the Lord, they are as healthy and clean as any in the 
parish.&nbsp; Why then should you complain?&nbsp; Godliness with 
contentment is great gain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An honour and a comfort to be a poor man, indeed!&nbsp;
What nonsense you talk!&nbsp; What sort of honour and comfort can
that be?&nbsp; I am out of patience with you, man,&rdquo; the 
wife sharply cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can prove it!&rdquo; replied he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; returned his partner, in no very pleasant 
tone of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the good man, &ldquo;hear me 
quietly, and I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it an honour, and I feel it a comfort, to be in
that very station of life which my Saviour Jesus Christ was in 
before me.&nbsp; He did not come into the world as one that was 
rich and great, but as a poor man, who had not where to lay his 
head.&nbsp; I feel a blessing in my poverty, because Jesus, like 
me, was poor.&nbsp; Had I been a rich man, perhaps I should never
have known nor loved him.&nbsp; &lsquo;For not many mighty, not 
many noble, are called.&rsquo;&nbsp; God&rsquo;s people are 
chiefly found among the base things of the world, and things 
which are despised.&nbsp; This makes my poverty to be my 
comfort.</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;Besides, hath not God chosen the poor of this 
world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath 
promised to them that love him?&nbsp; This thought makes my 
poverty also to be my honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, to the poor the gospel was and is preached, 
and to my heart&rsquo;s delight I find it to be true, every 
Sunday of my life.&nbsp; And is it not plain, all the 
neighbourhood through, that while so many of our rich farmers, 
and tradesmen, and squires, are quite careless, or set their 
faces against the ways of God, and are dead to everything that is
gracious and holy; a great number of the poorest people are 
converted and live?&nbsp; I honour the rich for their station, 
but I do not envy them for their possessions.&nbsp; I can not 
forget what Christ once said, &lsquo;How hardly shall they that 
have riches enter into the kingdom of God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear wife, if you did but know how to set a 
right value upon the precious promises which God has made to the 
poor, how thankful should I be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The expectation of the poor shall not perish.&nbsp; He 
delivereth the poor and needy from him that spoileth him.&nbsp; 
He has prepared of his goodness for the poor.&nbsp; The poor 
among men shall rejoice in the holy one.&nbsp; For he became 
poor, that we, through his poverty might be rich; not in gold, 
but in grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These promises comfort my soul, and would make me 
happy, even if I were deprived of that which I now enjoy.&nbsp; I
can trust my Saviour for this world as well as for the 
next.&nbsp; He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up 
for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all 
things?</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;The Lord of his mercy bless you, my dear Sarah, 
with the grace of a contented mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the gracious man stopped: and whether affected by her 
husband&rsquo;s discourse, or by any other cause, I know not, but
she made no reply.&nbsp; He then said, &ldquo;Come, children, it 
is our time for rest; shut the door, and let us go to 
prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said I, laying hold of the door, as 
the child was obeying her father&rsquo;s orders, &ldquo;if I ask 
leave to make one in your family devotions, before I travel 
homeward.&nbsp; I have heard you, my friend, when you knew it 
not, and bless God for the sermon which you have this night 
preached to my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The honest labourer blushed for a moment at this unexpected 
intrusion and declaration, but immediately said, &ldquo;Sir, you 
are welcome to a poor man&rsquo;s dwelling, if you come in the 
name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just looked round at the wife, who seemed to be startled at 
my sudden appearance, and the six fine children who sat near her,
and then said, &ldquo;You were going to pray; I must beg of you, 
without regarding me, to go on as if I were not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, whom I could not but love and reverence, with a 
simple, unaffected, modest, and devout demeanour, did as I 
requested him.&nbsp; His prayer was full of tender affection and 
sincerity, expressed with great Scriptural propriety, and was in 
all respects such as became the preacher of those sentiments 
which I have overheard him deliver to his wife just before.</p>
<p>When he had finished, each of his children, according to the 
good old patriarchal custom of better days, <!-- page 197--><a 
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>kneeled 
down before him in turn to receive a father&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>It was now late, and the rain was over.&nbsp; I gave the poor 
man my blessing, and received his in return.&nbsp; I wished them 
good night, and went onwards to my own home, reflecting with much
self-abasement of heart, what an honour and comfort it is to be a
poor man, rich in faith.</p>
<h2><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>A VISIT TO THE INFIRMARY.</h2>
<p>I went a few months since to visit a parishioner, then in the 
county infirmary, within some miles of which I reside, and was 
informed that in an adjoining ward there lay a very good old man,
confined by a mortification in his foot, who would take 
particular satisfaction in any Christian conversation which my 
time would allow me to afford him.</p>
<p>The nurse conducted me into a room where I found him alone on 
a bed.&nbsp; The character of his countenance was venerable, 
cheerful, contented, and pious.&nbsp; His hoary hairs proclaimed 
him to be aged, although the liveliness in his eye was equal to 
that of the most vigorous youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, my friend?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir, very well.&nbsp; Never better in all my
life.&nbsp; Thank God for all his mercies!&rdquo; replied the 
man, with so cheerful a tone of voice as at once surprised and 
delighted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&nbsp; How so?&nbsp; I thought from what I 
heard you were in much pain and weakness,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that is true; but I am very well for all 
that.&nbsp; For God is so good to my soul, and he provides 
everything needful for my body.&nbsp; The people in the house are
very kind; <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and friends come to see me, and talk
and pray with me.&nbsp; Sir, I want nothing but more grace to 
praise the Lord for all his goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my friend, you are an old pilgrim, and I am glad 
to see that you have learned thankfulness as you travel through 
the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankfulness!&rdquo; quickly returned he.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No, sir; I never did thank the Lord, I never could thank 
him; no, nor I never shall thank him as I ought, till I get to 
glory.&nbsp; And then&mdash;oh, then&mdash;how I will thank him 
for what he has done for me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Tears of affection 
filled his eyes as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a good Master you serve!&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, if the servant was but as good as the 
Master.&nbsp; But here I am, a poor old sinner, deserving 
nothing, and receiving everything which I need.&nbsp; Sir, I want
nothing but more grace to serve him better.&nbsp; I lie here on 
this bed, and pray and sing by night and day.&nbsp; Sir, you must
let me sing you my hymn; I always begin it about four 
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and it keeps my spirits alive all 
the day through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for my reply, he raised himself up, and in an 
aged and broken, but very affecting tone of voice, he sang two or
three verses, expressive of God&rsquo;s goodness to him, and his 
own desire to live to God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; The simplicity, 
serenity, and heartfelt consolation, with which this venerable 
disciple went through it, gave a colouring to the whole, and left
an impression on my mind which it would be impossible to convey 
to the reader.</p>
<p>As soon as he had finished his hymn, he said, &ldquo;Do not be
offended, sir, at my boldness: you love the Lord, too, I hope; 
and then I am sure you won&rsquo;t be angry to hear me praise 
him.&nbsp; But now, sir, talk to me about Jesus Christ.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
200</span>You are his minister, and he has sent you here to-day 
to see a poor unworthy soul, that does not deserve the least of 
his mercies.&nbsp; Talk to me, sir, if you please about Jesus 
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither you nor I are able to talk of him as we 
ought,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;and yet, if we were to hold our 
peace, the very stones would cry out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and well they might, sir, cry shame, shame upon us,
if we refused to speak of his goodness,&rdquo; said the old 
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;is a sure 
refuge, and a present help in time of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir; so he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ has taken care of you, and watched over 
you all the days of your life; and he will be your guide and 
portion in death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right again, sir; so he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have committed your soul into his keeping long 
since, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About forty years ago, sir; about forty years ago, 
(when I first used to hear Mr. Venn and Mr. Berridge,) he came to
seek and to save me, a vile sinner, who deserved nothing but his 
wrath.&nbsp; I can never praise him enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my friend, and this very Saviour, Jesus Christ, 
whom you love, and in whom you trust, lived for you, and died for
you; he rose again for you, and has sanctified you by his Holy 
Spirit, and now lives to make daily intercession for you: and 
having done all this, do you think he will leave you to perish at
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the old man: &ldquo;faithful is he
that hath promised, and will do it.&nbsp; Mine, alack, is a 
changing heart; but he changeth not.&nbsp; I believe that he hath
laid up a crown of glory for me; and though the old enemy of 
souls sometimes <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>tells me I shan&rsquo;t have it, I 
believe in Christ sooner than in him, and I trust I shall have it
at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you not find by experience,&rdquo; I added, 
&ldquo;that his yoke is easy, and his burden light?&nbsp; His 
commandments are not grievous, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, no: it is a man&rsquo;s meat and drink, if he 
loves the Lord, to do what he bids him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you before you came into this 
infirmary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the parish workhouse of S---.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She died some years since, and got to her heavenly home
before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have two sons married, and settled in the 
world with families.&nbsp; One of them has been here to see me 
lately, and I hope he is in a good way for his own soul, and 
brings up his children in the fear of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any worldly cares upon your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Not one</i>, sir.&nbsp; I am come to this house, I 
plainly see, to end my days; for this mortification in my leg 
must, before it be very long, bring me to the grave.&nbsp; And I 
am quite willing, sir, to go, or to wait the Lord&rsquo;s own 
time.&nbsp; I want nothing, sir, but more grace to praise 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which last words he often repeated in the 
course of the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have reason,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to feel thankful
that there is such a house as this for poor and sick people to be
brought to, for both food, lodging, and medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have, indeed, sir; it is a house of mercies to 
me, and I am ashamed to hear how unthankful many of the patients 
seem to be for the benefits which the Lord provides for them 
here.&nbsp; But, poor creatures, they neither know nor <!-- page 
202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
202</span>love him.&nbsp; The Lord have mercy upon them, and show
them the right way.&nbsp; I should never have known that good 
way, sir, if he had not taken compassion upon me, when I had none
upon myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears ran down his aged cheeks as he spoke these last 
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;is a poor man 
that is very rich, and a weak man that is very 
strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment the nurse brought in his 
dinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, sir, you see, more and more 
mercies!&nbsp; The Lord takes care of me, and sends me plenty of 
food for this poor, old worn-out body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that poor old worn-out 
body will one day be renewed and become a glorified body, and 
live along with your soul in the presence of God for 
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, sir,&rdquo; said the good old man, 
&ldquo;so it will: &lsquo;though after my skin worms destroy this
body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, come, 
sir,&rdquo; seeing me look at my watch, &ldquo;you must speak a 
word <i>to</i> your Master, if you please, as well as <i>for</i> 
him.&nbsp; I will put down my dinner while you pray with 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so, the man often adding his confirmation of what I 
offered up by voice, gesture, and countenance, in a manner highly
expressive of the agreement of his heart with the language of the
prayer.</p>
<p>Having ended, he said, &ldquo;God be with you, sir, and bless 
your labours to many poor souls!&nbsp; I hope you will come to 
see me again, if my life be spared.&nbsp; I am so glad to see 
those who will talk to me about Jesus Christ, and his precious 
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, 
who carried them through the days of their pilgrimage, and <!-- 
page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
203</span>brought them safe to a city which hath foundations, 
bring you there too, and bless you all the remaining days of your
journey till you get home!&nbsp; I am going to see several 
serious friends this evening, who would be glad, I know, to 
receive a message from one who has had so much experience of a 
Saviour&rsquo;s mercies.&nbsp; What shall I say to 
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them, sir, with my Christian love and respects, 
that you have been to see a poor dying old man, who wants nothing
at all in this world but more grace to praise the Lord 
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ended our first interview.&nbsp; I could not help 
reflecting, as I returned homewards, that, as the object of my 
journey to the infirmary had been to carry instruction and 
consolation myself to the poor and the sick; so the poor and the 
sick were made instrumental to the conveying of both instruction 
and consolation to my own heart in a very superior degree.</p>
<p>I saw him four or five times afterwards, and always found him 
in the same happy, patient, thankful, and edifying state of mind 
and conversation.&nbsp; The last time I was with him, he said, 
&ldquo;Sir, I long to be at my heavenly home, but I am willing to
remain a traveller as long as my Lord and Master sees 
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He died <a name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203" 
class="citation">[203]</a> not long after my last sight of him, 
in the steadfast assurance of faith, and with a full hope of 
immortality.</p>

<p>An interesting account of a visit recently made to the 
Dairyman&rsquo;s cottage appeared in the <i>Christian 
Guardian</i> for October 1813.&nbsp; A still more recent visit to

<p><a name="footnote105"></a><a href="#citation105"

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
